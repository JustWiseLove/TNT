                        <p>The Bible’s historical accuracy is confirmed by extensive archaeological evidence, such as the Tel Dan Stele, which corroborates 2 Samuel 8:13, “David made a name when he struck down the Edomites.” The Lachish Letters align with Jeremiah 34:7, detailing Judah’s defense against Babylon. These findings affirm the Bible’s reliability as a historical record, proving its accounts are not myths but grounded in reality, as Psalm 119:160 declares, “The very essence of your word is truth.” This precision reflects Jehovah’s oversight in preserving His Word, as Isaiah 46:10 states, “My purpose will take effect, and I will carry out all that I please.”</p>

These findings affirm the Bible’s reliability as a historical record, proving its accounts are not myths but grounded in reality, as Psalm 119:160 declares, “The very essence of your word is truth.” This precision reflects Jehovah’s oversight in preserving His Word, as Isaiah 46:10 states, “My purpose will take effect, and I will carry out all that I please.”' },

Isaiah 40:22 describes the earth as a circle, “He stretches out the heavens like a fine gauze,” suggesting its spherical nature and the universe’s expansion. Job 26:7 notes, “He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing,” reflecting an understanding of the earth’s position in space. These statements, penned centuries ago, demonstrate divine insight, as 2 Timothy 3:16 affirms, “All Scripture is inspired of God,” revealing Jehovah’s wisdom beyond human knowledge.' },

Daniel 2:44 foretold, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed,” accurately predicting world powers like Babylon and Rome. Micah 5:2 pinpointed Bethlehem as the Messiah’s birthplace, fulfilled in Jesus, as Matthew 2:1 confirms. These fulfillments, among hundreds, reflect Jehovah’s sovereignty, as Isaiah 55:11 declares, “My word that goes out of my mouth will not return to me without results.” Only a divine mind could foresee such events.' },
