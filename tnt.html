            <p class="scripture">For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable. — Romans 1:20</p>
            <p>Jehovah’s truth shines through creation, from vast oceans to microscopic cells, revealing His infinite wisdom, power, and purpose in every intricate detail of the natural world.</p>

                        <h2>Cosmos and Earth Testify to Jehovah’s Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>The universe’s majestic order, from galaxies to oceans, proclaims Jehovah’s purposeful design, as “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and the expanse is proclaiming the work of his hands.” Creation’s harmony and complexity demand a divine architect, evident in every star and wave. — Psalm 19:1</p>

                        <h3>Galaxies: Cosmic Masterpieces</h3>
                        <p>Over 2 trillion galaxies, each with 100 billion stars, orbit with precision, as “He is counting the number of the stars; all of them he calls by their names.” The Milky Way spans 100,000 light-years, its 200 billion stars in perfect balance. David was awed, saying, “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?” The Hubble telescope reveals galaxies 13.8 billion light-years away, as “Jehovah’s works are great.” Their 10^24 stars, orbiting at 1.3 million mph, defy chance, proving “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” — Psalm 147:4, Psalm 8:3-4, Psalm 111:2, Psalm 104:24</p>

                        <h3>Ecosystems: Interwoven Harmony</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s ecosystems, like coral reefs with 1 million species, thrive in balance, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” Rainforests, 6% of land, produce 20% oxygen for 7.8 billion people. Isaiah declared, “It is he who stretched out the heavens like a fine gauze.” One forest acre hosts 70,000 insects, 1,500 plants, 200 mammals, as “All things came into existence through him.” This interdependence, recycling 10 billion tons of carbon yearly, demands design. — Psalm 104:24, Isaiah 40:22, John 1:3</p>

                        <h2>Creatures Showcase Divine Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>Animals, from tireless ants to mighty elephants, reveal Jehovah’s care, as “Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into storehouses; yet your heavenly Father feeds them.” Their intricate designs and behaviors provide undeniable evidence of purposeful creation. — Matthew 6:26</p>

                        <h3>Ants: Architects of Teamwork</h3>
                        <p>Ants, lifting 50 times their 3mg weight, build colonies of 10,000, as “Go to the ant, you lazy one; observe its ways and become wise.” Solomon admired diligence. Pheromone trails guide foraging 100 meters, with 10-second antennal contacts. 700,000 species recycle 10% of biomass, defending nests with 90% success. This teamwork, as “Jehovah’s works are great,” proves divine foresight. — Proverbs 6:6, Psalm 111:2</p>

                        <h3>Whales: Navigators of the Deep</h3>
                        <p>Humpback whales, at 40 tons, migrate 3,000 miles with echolocation accurate to 1 meter, as “You wild animals and all you domestic animals, you creeping things and winged birds!” Job marveled, saying, “Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook?” Songs travel 10 miles, coordinating pods. 5,000-liter lungs dive 1,000 feet, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” proving engineering. — Psalm 148:10, Job 41:1, Psalm 104:24</p>

                        <h3>Bone Structure: Framework of Strength</h3>
                        <p>The 206 bones, five times stronger than steel, support 500 muscles, as “You are the one fortifying me with strength for the battle.” David praised, saying, “All my bones will say: ‘O Jehovah, who is like you?’” Bones, 14% body weight, withstand 1,600 pounds, regenerating every 10 years. Lattice design, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” defies chance. — Psalm 18:39, Psalm 35:10, Psalm 104:24</p>

                        <h3>Forests: Lungs of Earth</h3>
                        <p>15 billion trees produce 40% of oxygen, as “The trees of Jehovah are satisfied.” David saw creation’s glory, saying, “Let the trees of the forest shout for joy before Jehovah.” Forests host 80% of biodiversity, sequestering 2.6 billion tons of CO2. This role, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” proves design. — Psalm 104:16, Psalm 96:12, Psalm 104:24</p>

                        <p>37 trillion cells, each with 100,000 molecules, form life, as “You yourself produced my kidneys; you kept me screened off in the womb of my mother.” David praised intricacy, saying, “Your eyes saw even the embryo of me.” Cells perform 10^16 reactions/second, with 200,000 protein types. This complexity, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” defies chance. — Psalm 139:13, Psalm 139:16, Psalm 104:24</p>
