                        <h2>Cosmos and Earth Proclaim Jehovah’s Glory</h2>
                        <p>The universe’s awe-inspiring order, from spiraling galaxies to delicate ecosystems, testifies to Jehovah’s purposeful design, as “the heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1). Creation’s complexity and harmony demand a divine architect, silencing doubt with undeniable evidence.</p>

                        <h3>Galaxies: Cosmic Symphonies</h3>
                        <p>Over 2 trillion galaxies, each with 100 billion stars, orbit with mathematical precision, as “he counts the number of the stars; he calls them all by name” (Psalm 147:4). The Milky Way’s 200 billion stars span 100,000 light-years, yet maintain stability. David marveled at the heavens’ vastness (Psalm 8:3-4), and Job learned of Jehovah’s power (Job 38:31-33). The Hubble telescope reveals galaxies 13.5 billion light-years away, as “his power is vast” (Job 26:14). This order, producing 10^24 stars, defies chance, proving “Jehovah’s works are wonderful” (Psalm 111:2).</p>

                        <h3>Ecosystems: Interwoven Balance</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s ecosystems, like coral reefs hosting 1 million species, thrive in delicate balance, as “the earth is full of your productions” (Psalm 104:24). Rainforests, covering 6% of land, generate 20% of oxygen, sustaining 7.8 billion people. Isaiah saw creation’s harmony (Isaiah 40:22). One acre of forest supports 70,000 insects, 1,500 plants, and 200 mammals, as “all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). This interdependence demands purposeful design.</p>

                        <h3>Weather Systems: Cycles of Renewal</h3>
                        <p>Weather systems cycle 37.5 trillion tons of water annually across 510 million square kilometers, as “all streams run to the sea, yet the sea is not full” (Ecclesiastes 1:7). Elijah witnessed Jehovah’s rain (1 Kings 18:41-45). Hurricanes release 600 trillion watts daily, yet nurture ecosystems. Winds obey, as “he makes the winds his messengers” (Psalm 104:4). This precision, as “he made everything beautiful” (Ecclesiastes 3:11), inspires awe.</p>

                        <h3>Geologic Formations: Timeless Testimony</h3>
                        <p>Mountains, like Everest at 29,032 feet, and canyons, like the Grand Canyon’s 277-mile span, showcase Jehovah’s power, as “the mountains rose, the valleys sank” (Psalm 104:8). Moses saw Sinai quake (Exodus 19:18). Plate tectonics recycle 43,000 square miles of crust yearly, stabilizing earth. These formations, as “the earth is Jehovah’s” (Psalm 24:1), prove His design.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Stargaze to ponder galaxies, explore forests for ecosystems, track storms for weather, or visit canyons for geologic awe. Journal observations, meditate on Jehovah’s wisdom, and share insights, as “praise Jehovah from the heavens” (Psalm 148:1-6).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Human Conscience Points to Truth</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Innate Morality Reflects Jehovah’s Standards</h2>
                        <p>The human conscience, an inner compass guiding right from wrong, reveals Jehovah’s truth, as “their conscience bears witness” (Romans 2:15). Universal across humanity, it distinguishes us from animals, pointing to a divine moral framework.</p>

                        <h3>Innate Morality in Infants</h3>
                        <p>Babies at 6 months prefer kind acts, showing innate morality, as “Jehovah has made everything for its purpose” (Proverbs 16:4). Joseph’s conscience resisted sin (Genesis 39:9). Studies show 80% of toddlers share, echoing “love your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:18). This instinct, as “God’s law is in their hearts” (Romans 2:15), proves a divine imprint.</p>

                        <h3>Universal Ethical Codes</h3>
                        <p>Cultures worldwide uphold justice and compassion, as “do justly, love mercy” (Micah 6:8). Paul urged a clear conscience (Acts 24:16). Anthropological data confirm 99% of societies condemn murder, aligning with “you shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13). This consistency, as “Jehovah’s righteousness endures” (Psalm 119:142), demands a purposeful origin.</p>

                        <h3>Conscience and Repentance</h3>
                        <p>Conscience drives repentance, as David’s heart struck him (2 Samuel 24:10). Peter wept after denying Jesus (Luke 22:61-62). Psychological studies show guilt prompts 70% of people to correct wrongs, as “return to Jehovah” (Isaiah 55:7). This mechanism, as “Jehovah searches all hearts” (1 Chronicles 28:9), reveals His design.</p>

                        <h3>Conscience in Decision-Making</h3>
                        <p>Conscience guides choices, as Daniel refused defiling food (Daniel 1:8). Jesus upheld truth under trial (John 18:37). Neuroscience shows the prefrontal cortex activates during moral dilemmas, processing 100,000 decisions daily. This capacity, as “choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19), proves Jehovah’s truth.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Reflect on conscience-driven choices, study scriptures to sharpen it, and act justly. Teach children moral values, as “train a child in the way” (Proverbs 22:6).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Their conscience bears witness.” — Romans 2:15</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Seasons and Rhythms Show Reliability</h2>
                        <p>Nature’s cycles—seasons, tides, migrations, and orbits—demonstrate Jehovah’s dependable truth, as “seedtime and harvest will not cease” (Genesis 8:22). Their unwavering precision builds trust in His eternal purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Seasonal Balance</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt drives seasons across 365.25 days, yielding 4.5 billion tons of crops, as “he made the sun to rule by day” (Psalm 136:8). Noah trusted seasonal renewal (Genesis 9:11-13). Seasons regulate 70% of ecosystems, as “Jehovah’s faithfulness endures” (Psalm 100:5). This rhythm proves His design.</p>

                        <h3>Tidal Harmony</h3>
                        <p>The moon’s gravity cycles tides every 12.4 hours, moving 1.4 trillion tons of water, as “he set the moon for seasons” (Psalm 104:19). Jesus noted nature’s reliability (Matthew 5:45). Tides sustain 50% of marine species, cleaning 71% of earth’s surface. This precision, as “Jehovah’s works are faithful” (Psalm 33:4), reflects purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Animal Migrations</h3>
                        <p>Monarch butterflies migrate 3,000 miles using sunlight, as “Jehovah’s works are great” (Psalm 111:2). Israelites saw quail migrations (Numbers 11:31-32). Arctic terns travel 25,000 miles yearly, guided by stars. This navigation, as “he gives to the beast its food” (Psalm 147:9), shows divine care.</p>

                        <h3>Planetary Orbits</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s 66,600 mph orbit around the sun, 93 million miles away, maintains life’s 15–30°C range, as “he established the earth on its foundations” (Psalm 104:5). Job learned of cosmic order (Job 38:33). Orbits vary by 0.0001%, ensuring stability. This accuracy, as “Jehovah’s counsel stands forever” (Psalm 33:11), proves design.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Track seasons, observe tides, watch migrations, or study orbits to trust Jehovah’s reliability. Plant a garden or journal cycles, as “wait for Jehovah” (Psalm 27:14).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Animals Display Jehovah’s Care</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Creatures Reveal Divine Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>Animals, from industrious ants to swift cheetahs, showcase Jehovah’s care and truth, as “look at the birds of heaven; they do not sow, yet your Father feeds them” (Matthew 6:26). Their intricate designs and behaviors provide compelling evidence of purposeful creation.</p>

                        <h3>Ants: Architects of Teamwork</h3>
                        <p>Ants, lifting 50 times their 3mg weight, build colonies of 10,000, as “go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways” (Proverbs 6:6-8). Solomon admired their diligence. Each ant follows pheromone trails, foraging 100 meters daily, coordinating via 10-second antennal contacts. With 700,000 species, ants cultivate fungi, recycle 10% of biomass, and defend nests with 90% success. This teamwork, as “Jehovah’s works are wonderful” (Psalm 111:2), defies evolutionary chance, proving divine foresight.</p>

                        <h3>Eagles: Masters of Vision</h3>
                        <p>Eagles soar 10,000 feet, spotting prey 3 miles away with 1 million cones per square millimeter, as “those hoping in Jehovah will soar on wings like eagles” (Isaiah 40:31). David saw eagles as strength (Psalm 103:5). Their 270-degree vision, 8x sharper than humans, and 7-foot wings lift 4kg loads. With 99% hunt accuracy, eagles, as “Jehovah’s eyes are everywhere” (Proverbs 15:3), reflect purposeful design.</p>

                        <h3>Whales: Navigators of the Deep</h3>
                        <p>Humpback whales, at 40 tons, migrate 3,000 miles using echolocation accurate to 1 meter, as “there is no creature hidden from his sight” (Psalm 104:25-26). Job marveled at leviathan (Job 41:1). Their songs, traveling 10 miles, coordinate pods of 12. Lungs hold 5,000 liters, diving 1,000 feet. This navigation, as “Jehovah’s works are great” (Psalm 111:2), demands a divine engineer.</p>

                        <h3>Bees: Engineers of Harmony</h3>
                        <p>Bees, pollinating 80% of crops, craft hexagonal hives with 0.1mm precision, as “Jehovah’s works are faithful” (Psalm 33:4). Samson found honey (Judges 14:8). Each bee, in 6 weeks, produces 1/12th teaspoon of honey, yet hives yield 60 pounds yearly. With 20,000 bees, hives maintain 35°C, supporting 130,000 plants. This cooperation, as “how pleasant when brothers dwell in unity” (Psalm 133:1), proves design.</p>

                        <h3>Salmon: Champions of Endurance</h3>
                        <p>Salmon swim 2,000 miles upstream, leaping 7-foot falls, guided by Earth’s magnetic field, as “Jehovah’s creation is vast” (Psalm 104:24). Israelites ate fish (Numbers 11:22). Their 99% homing accuracy produces 7,000 eggs per female, sustaining 5 billion fish. Muscles generate 400 watts, defying currents. This endurance, as “run to win” (1 Corinthians 9:24), reflects divine purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Cheetahs: Sprinters of Precision</h3>
                        <p>Cheetahs hit 60 mph in 3 seconds, with hearts pumping 170 beats/minute, as “Jehovah’s works are awesome” (Psalm 66:3). David likened pursuit to swift beasts (Psalm 18:37). Flexible spines, 4-inch claws, and 450-muscle frames ensure 95% hunt success. Eyes lock on prey at 70 meters. This speed, as “Jehovah gives strength” (Isaiah 40:29), proves creation’s intent.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Observe ants for teamwork, eagles for vision, whales for navigation, bees for harmony, salmon for endurance, and cheetahs for precision. Study wildlife documentaries, reflect on Jehovah’s care, and journal lessons, as “praise Jehovah from the earth” (Psalm 148:7).</p>

Bones, at 14% body weight, withstand 1,600 pounds, regenerating every 10 years. Their lattice design, as “Jehovah’s works are wonderful” (Psalm 111:2), defies chance.</p>

                        <h3>Human Eye: Window of Precision</h3>
                        <p>The eye’s 120 million rods and 7 million cones process 10 million bits/second, as “the seeing eye, Jehovah made” (Proverbs 20:12). Jesus restored sight (Mark 8:25). Its 2 million parts autofocus in 0.2 seconds, surpassing cameras. With 576-megapixel resolution, as “Jehovah’s works are great” (Psalm 111:2), it proves design.</p>

                        <h3>Brain: Citadel of Thought</h3>
                        <p>The brain’s 86 billion neurons form 100 trillion connections, as “love Jehovah with your whole mind” (Matthew 22:37). Paul saw the body as a temple (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). It processes 11 million inputs daily, storing 2.5 petabytes. This complexity, as “how great are your works” (Psalm 92:5), demands purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Nervous System: Instant Network</h3>
                        <p>The nervous system’s 7 trillion nerves transmit signals at 268 mph, as “Jehovah’s works are marvelous” (Psalm 139:14). Job felt life’s spark (Job 33:4). It coordinates 37 trillion cells, reacting in 0.01 seconds. This network, as “he knows our frame” (Psalm 103:14), shows divine engineering.</p>

                        <h3>Heart: Pump of Life</h3>
                        <p>The heart pumps 2,000 gallons daily across 60,000 miles of vessels, as “the life is in the blood” (Leviticus 17:11). David sought a pure heart (Psalm 51:10). Beating 100,000 times daily, it delivers 5 liters per minute. This endurance, as “Jehovah’s works are faithful” (Psalm 33:4), proves design.</p>

                        <h3>DNA: Code of Creation</h3>
                        <p>DNA’s 3 billion base pairs encode 20,000 genes, as “you knitted me in my mother’s womb” (Psalm 139:13). Moses saw life’s sanctity (Exodus 20:13). Each cell holds 2 meters of DNA, with 99.9% error-free replication. This code, as “Jehovah’s counsel stands” (Psalm 33:11), defies random origin.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Study anatomy, exercise to honor bones, protect eyes, and engage the mind in worship. Reflect on DNA’s code, as “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14).</p>

                        <h2>Nature Teaches Wisdom and Faith</h2>
                        <p>Creation’s patterns impart spiritual truths, as “consider the lilies, how they grow without toiling” (Luke 12:27-28). From trees to stars, nature’s lessons strengthen trust in Jehovah.</p>

                        <h3>Trees: Symbols of Endurance</h3>
                        <p>Trees, like cedars growing 150 feet, endure centuries, as “the righteous will flourish like a palm tree” (Psalm 92:12). David saw trees as strength (Psalm 1:3). Rings mark 4,000 years, with roots spanning 100 meters. This resilience, as “Jehovah’s works are great” (Psalm 111:2), teaches patience.</p>

                        <h3>Rivers: Paths of Persistence</h3>
                        <p>Rivers carve canyons over millennia, as “let justice roll down like waters” (Amos 5:24). Moses crossed the Jordan (Joshua 3:17). The Amazon moves 209,000 cubic meters/second, shaping 4,000 miles. This persistence, as “Jehovah’s counsel stands” (Psalm 33:11), mirrors faith.</p>

                        <h3>Stars: Lights of Eternity</h3>
                        <p>Stars, burning 10 billion years, number 10^24, as “he determines the number of the stars” (Psalm 147:4). Abraham saw stars as promise (Genesis 15:5). They fuse 600 million tons of hydrogen/second, lighting 13.8 billion light-years. This eternity, as “the heavens declare his righteousness” (Psalm 97:6), inspires hope.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Study trees for endurance, rivers for persistence, and stars for hope. Reflect on nature’s lessons, journal insights, and grow in faith, as “meditate on his works” (Psalm 77:12).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Consider the lilies.” — Luke 12:27</p>

            <!-- Item 8: Stewardship of Creation -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Stewardship of Creation</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Caring for Earth Honors Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Stewardship preserves Jehovah’s creation, as “Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, and put the man there to cultivate it” (Genesis 2:15). Caring for earth reflects trust in His truth.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting Ecosystems</h3>
                        <p>Ecosystems, with 8.7 million species, thrive in balance, as “the earth is Jehovah’s” (Psalm 24:1). Noah preserved animals (Genesis 7:2-3). Deforestation threatens 50% of species, yet reforestation saves 17 trees per ton of recycled paper. This care, as “Jehovah’s works are faithful” (Psalm 33:4), honors Him.</p>

                        <h3>Conserving Resources</h3>
                        <p>Conserving water and soil sustains life, as “he gives to all life and breath” (Acts 17:25). Israelites rested land (Leviticus 25:4-5). Recycling 1 ton of plastic saves 7,200 kWh. This stewardship, as “guard what is entrusted” (1 Timothy 6:20), reflects purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Promoting Biodiversity</h3>
                        <p>Biodiversity, with 1.5 million named species, glorifies Jehovah, as “how many are your works” (Psalm 104:24). Adam named animals (Genesis 2:19-20). Protecting 30% of land preserves 80% of species. This effort, as “Jehovah’s glory endures” (Psalm 104:31), proves devotion.</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Plant trees, recycle, and protect habitats. Teach stewardship, reduce waste, and honor Jehovah’s earth, as “care for it” (Genesis 2:15).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Cultivate and keep it.” — Genesis 2:15</p>
