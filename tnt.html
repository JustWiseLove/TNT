                        <h2>Cosmos and Earth Proclaim Jehovah’s Glory</h2>
                        <p>The universe’s order, from galaxies to ecosystems, testifies to Jehovah’s wisdom, as “the heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1). Stars, numbering over 100 billion per galaxy, align in precise orbits, showcasing purposeful design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> David marveled at the starry heavens (Psalm 8:3-4). Job learned of Jehovah’s power through creation’s vastness (Job 38:4-7). Isaiah affirmed Jehovah’s design, as “he stretches out the heavens like a tent” (Isaiah 40:22). Creation silences skeptics, as “there is no speech, yet their voice is heard” (Psalm 19:3).</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Earth’s atmosphere, with 21% oxygen, sustains life perfectly, unlike Venus’ toxic clouds. The water cycle, recycling 332,500 cubic miles annually, reflects foresight (Ecclesiastes 1:7). Such precision points to a purposeful intelligent design, as “Jehovah’s works are wonderful” (Psalm 111:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Observe stars, forests, or rivers to strengthen faith. Study creation’s patterns, meditate on Jehovah’s wisdom, and share insights, as “praise Jehovah from the earth” (Psalm 148:7-13).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Human Conscience Points to Truth</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Innate Morality Reflects Jehovah’s Standards</h2>
                        <p>The human conscience, an inner guide to right and wrong, reveals Jehovah’s truth, as “Gentiles, without the law, do by nature what the law requires” (Romans 2:14-15). This moral compass, universal across cultures, points to a divine lawgiver.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Joseph’s conscience resisted sin (Genesis 39:9). Paul urged a clear conscience (Acts 24:16). The conscience aligns with Jehovah’s standards, as “love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18). It convicts wrongdoers, as “their conscience bears witness” (Romans 2:15).</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Studies show even infants prefer kind actions, suggesting innate morality. Cultures worldwide value justice, echoing Jehovah’s design (Micah 6:8). Unlike animals, humans reflect on morality, as “Jehovah has made everything for its purpose” (Proverbs 16:4).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Listen to your conscience, refine it with scripture, and act justly. Teach others Jehovah’s standards, trusting “he has shown you what is good” (Micah 6:8).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Their conscience bears witness.” — Romans 2:15</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Creation’s Cycles Teach Trust</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Seasons and Harvests Show Reliability</h2>
                        <p>Nature’s cycles—seasons, tides, harvests—demonstrate Jehovah’s dependable truth, as “seedtime and harvest will not cease” (Genesis 8:22). The earth’s 23.5-degree tilt ensures seasonal balance, sustaining life with precision.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Noah trusted Jehovah’s post-flood promise (Genesis 9:11-13). The Israelites relied on harvest cycles (Leviticus 26:4-5). Jesus noted nature’s reliability, as “the sun rises on the evil and the good” (Matthew 5:45). Cycles teach trust, as “Jehovah’s faithfulness endures” (Psalm 100:5).</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The moon’s gravitational pull drives tides, cycling 12.4 hours daily. Plants photosynthesize, producing 150 billion tons of oxygen yearly, showing Jehovah’s provision (Psalm 104:14). Such consistency builds faith, as “Jehovah’s works are faithful” (Psalm 33:4).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Observe seasonal changes, thank Jehovah for provision, and trust His timing. Plant a garden to learn patience, as “wait for Jehovah” (Psalm 27:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Seedtime and harvest will not cease.” — Genesis 8:22</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Creatures Teach Wisdom and Trust</h2>
                        <p>Animals, from diligent ants to soaring eagles, reveal Jehovah’s care and truth, as “look at the birds of heaven; they do not sow, yet your Father feeds them” (Matthew 6:26). Their instincts and abilities reflect divine design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Solomon learned diligence from ants (Proverbs 6:6-8). Isaiah saw eagles as symbols of strength (Isaiah 40:31). Job marveled at whales’ vastness (Job 41:1). Bees’ cooperation inspired Samson (Judges 14:8). Salmon’s migrations show perseverance (Psalm 104:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Ants carry 50 times their weight, showing teamwork. Eagles’ eyes detect prey from 3 miles, reflecting vision. Whales navigate 3,000-mile migrations using echolocation. Bees pollinate 80% of crops, sustaining ecosystems. Salmon swim 2,000 miles upstream, defying currents. These feats, as “Jehovah’s works are great” (Psalm 111:2), point to purposeful design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Watch wildlife, learn diligence from ants, vision from eagles, and perseverance from salmon. Reflect on Jehovah’s care, as “he provides food for the cattle” (Psalm 147:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Look at the birds of heaven.” — Matthew 6:26</p>

                        <h2>Bones, Eyes, Brain Show Design</h2>
                        <p>The human body, with its intricate bone structure, eyes, and brain, proclaims Jehovah’s truth, as “I am wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14). Each component reveals unmatched engineering.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> David praised Jehovah’s design of man (Psalm 139:13-16). Solomon noted the eye’s precision (Proverbs 20:12). Paul saw the body as a temple for worship (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). The body’s complexity, as “Jehovah’s works are wonderful” (Psalm 111:2), demands a purposeful intelligent design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Bones, lighter than steel yet five times stronger, support 206 structures, flexing without breaking. The eye’s 120 million rods and 7 million cones process 10 million bits of data per second, rivaling cameras. The brain’s 86 billion neurons form 100 trillion connections, enabling thought, memory, and worship. These, as “how great are your works” (Psalm 92:5), defy chance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Study anatomy, care for your body, and marvel at Jehovah’s design. Use your mind to worship, as “love Jehovah with your whole mind” (Matthew 22:37).</p>

                        <h2>Provision Enables Jehovah’s Work</h2>
                        <p>Earth’s resources—water, food, materials—enable service to Jehovah, as “God provides all things richly for our enjoyment” (1 Timothy 6:17). These gifts reflect His truth and care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> The Israelites received manna, sustaining worship (Exodus 16:35). Elijah trusted ravens for food (1 Kings 17:4-6). Jesus fed thousands, showing provision (Matthew 14:19-21). Resources support service, as “Jehovah gives food to every creature” (Psalm 136:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Earth’s 326 million trillion gallons of water sustain 7.8 billion people. Soil yields 4.5 billion tons of crops annually. Forests provide 15 billion trees for oxygen, shelter. These, as “the earth is full of your productions” (Psalm 104:24), empower ministry and life.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Use resources wisely, thank Jehovah for provisions, and serve diligently, as “seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33).</p>

                        <h2>Caring for Earth Honors Truth</h2>
                        <p>Stewardship of creation, by preserving Jehovah’s works, reflects trust in His truth, as “Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, and put the man there to cultivate it” (Genesis 2:15). Care for earth honors Him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Adam was tasked with earth’s care (Genesis 1:28). Noah preserved animals, trusting Jehovah (Genesis 7:2-3).
