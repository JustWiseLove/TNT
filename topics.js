    "D": "Christmas stems from the Roman Saturnalia, a debauched festival honoring Saturn with drunken orgies, human sacrifices, and lawless role reversals where slaves mocked masters, often sparking violence. Evergreen trees, adorned to appease winter spirits, and gift-giving, mimicking offerings to false gods, perpetuate lies of divine favor. The Bible gives no date for Jesus’ birth; December 25 aligns with sun god worship, not truth. Modern practices—Santa Claus as a magical judge, twinkling lights echoing pagan solstice rites—glorify myths, not Jehovah. Exodus 20:3 forbids other gods, and John 4:24 demands worship in truth, which this pagan revelry defiles."

    "D": "Easter derives from worship of Ēostre, a Germanic fertility goddess, with rituals of sexual unions and eggs smeared with sacrificial blood to symbolize reproduction. Rabbits, chosen for rampant breeding, were idols of lustful life cycles. The Bible never ties Jesus’ resurrection to April or commands its celebration; the date mimics spring equinox rites. Easter egg hunts and bunny symbols perpetuate pagan fertility lies, not biblical truth. Sunrise services echo sun worship, defying Deuteronomy 12:30-31’s warning against pagan ways. John 4:24 requires pure worship, which this sensual idolatry violates."

Fireworks mimic war’s explosions, and flag-waving exalts a nation over Jehovah’s Kingdom. The liberty proclaimed ignores enslaved and Native victims, a lie of universal freedom. Parades and anthems glorify human rule, not God’s. Isaiah 2:4 envisions peace, not war’s carnage.

Grave decorations and military parades glorify killing, masking the horror of mangled bodies and orphaned children. The holiday’s claim to honor sacrifice lies, as it exalts human conflicts over Jehovah’s peace. Matthew 5:44 commands loving enemies, not celebrating their slaughter.

Turkey feasts and harvest imagery hide the blood of scalped tribes and enslaved peoples. The holiday’s gratitude narrative lies, focusing on human prosperity, not Jehovah. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 calls for constant thanks to God, not a day celebrating conquest.

    "D": "New Year’s Day stems from Roman worship of Janus, with drunken orgies and animal sacrifices to ensure prosperity. Fireworks, resolutions, and lucky foods like black-eyed peas mimic pagan divination, falsely promising divine favor. The date, tied to a human calendar, exalts man’s timekeeping over Jehovah’s eternal plan. Galatians 4:9-10 condemns observing special days, and Isaiah 1:14 declares God’s hatred for such festivals.

    "D": "Valentine’s Day originates from Lupercalia, a Roman festival where priests whipped women with bloody hides for fertility and paired couples for sexual rites. Hearts, roses, and chocolates promote lustful romance, not godly love. The martyr Valentine’s link is a myth, masking pagan sensuality. 2 Timothy 2:22 calls for fleeing fleshly desires, and 1 Corinthians 10:14 rejects idolatry.

    "D": "Mother’s Day stems from worship of Cybele, whose followers castrated themselves and engaged in temple prostitution to honor the mother goddess. Modern cards, flowers, and brunches, pushed by commerce, exalt humans over Jehovah. Anna Jarvis, its founder, denounced its greed-driven distortion. Matthew 12:50 defines true family as those doing God’s will, not a special day. Exodus 20:12 commands constant honor, not pagan-rooted celebrations.

    "D": "Father’s Day, tied to Mother’s Day, shares its roots in Cybele’s cult, with bloody rituals and frenzied worship of a false goddess. Ties, tools, and barbecues exalt human fathers, not Jehovah, the ultimate Father. The holiday’s commercial push lies, claiming one day suffices for honor. Ephesians 6:4 demands ongoing godly parenting, not worldly celebrations.

    "D": "St. Patrick’s Day promotes the Trinity, a false doctrine using shamrocks to depict a triune god, unmentioned in scripture. Rooted in Celtic Druidic rites, it features drunken parades and green beer, glorifying excess. Leprechauns and pots of gold echo pagan myths of spirit beings. John 4:24 demands worship in truth, which the Trinity lie defies. Deuteronomy 4:15-16 forbids idolatrous images like shamrocks.

The holiday’s narrative of worker triumph lies, ignoring exploited laborers and worldly systems.

Parades and statues glorify his conquests, lying about ‘discovery’ while ignoring slaughtered tribes. Micah 6:8 demands kindness, not cruelty’s celebration. James 4:4 warns against worldly alliances.

Recycling drives and green pledges deify the planet, lying that human efforts save it. Romans 1:25 condemns venerating creation over Jehovah.

Crowds watching a groundhog’s shadow as prophecy perpetuate this superstition. Leviticus 19:26 bans omens, and Isaiah 44:25 shows Jehovah nullifies false signs.

Bead-throwing and masked parades promote lust and chaos, lying about divine approval. 1 Peter 4:3 rejects such brazen conduct, and Galatians 5:19-21 bars drunkards from God’s Kingdom.

Esther 9:26 notes the event, but no scripture mandates its celebration. Costumed revelry and gift-giving mimic idolatrous rites. Deuteronomy 12:32 forbids adding human traditions to God’s worship.

Crowds engage in drunken revelry, throwing dyes to mimic mythic seductions.

At Jesus’ baptism (Matthew 3:16-17), Jehovah’s voice from heaven identifies Jesus as His Son, while the holy spirit descends separately—three distinct entities, not one. Jesus plainly stated, ‘the Father is greater than I am’ (John 14:28), showing he is not equal to Jehovah. Paul affirms that Jesus remains in subjection to God even after all things are subjected to him (1 Corinthians 15:27-28). The Trinity doctrine originated in pagan philosophy and was adopted centuries after the Bible was written. Jehovah’s Witnesses rightly reject it, staying loyal to what the Scriptures truly teach."

Millions of innocent lives were lost, including around 4,200 of Jehovah’s Witnesses—men, women, and even children—who refused to compromise their faith. While Jews were targeted for their ethnicity, Witnesses were persecuted for their beliefs. Revelation 12:17 helps us see this as part of Satan’s war against true Christians. John 15:19 shows the world’s hatred for those who remain separate from its politics and wars. Jehovah’s Witnesses, unlike most religious groups, refused to support the Nazi regime, even when it meant imprisonment or death. This history confirms the truth of 2 Timothy 3:1, 3—“fierce” conditions would mark the last days. But despite all this, Jehovah preserved His people, and their integrity glorified Him."

The New World Translation accurately renders it 'wild bull' (Job 39:9-10). Proverbs 30:5-6 reminds us not to add to God’s Word.

    "D": "In 1914, Jehovah established His Kingdom in heaven with Jesus Christ as King, marking the start of the last days. Daniel 4:17, interpreted through the ‘seven times’ prophecy, points to 1914 as the end of Gentile rule, calculated from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 B.C.E. Luke 21:24 confirms the ‘appointed times’ ended then, ushering in Christ’s reign. Revelation 12:6 links to the period when Satan was ousted from heaven, intensifying earthly woes. Unlike premillennialist views in some Protestant churches, which misapply 1914 or expect a future rapture, the Bible ties this date to Christ’s invisible presence, proven by global signs like wars and earthquakes since 1914."

    "D": "Abortion is the unlawful taking of life, as Jehovah views the unborn as living souls. Exodus 21:22, 23 demands accountability for harming a fetus, equating it to murder. Psalm 139:16 shows Jehovah knows the embryo, assigning it value from conception. Unlike liberal Christian or secular views that prioritize personal choice, the Bible upholds the sanctity of life, condemning abortion except when the mother’s life is directly at risk.

      "Matthew 6:34 - <em>Never be anxious about the next day.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Anxiety is countered by trusting Jehovah through prayer and focus on His Kingdom. Philippians 4:6, 7 promises God’s peace guards those who pray, while Matthew 6:34 advises against worrying about tomorrow. Unlike secular psychology or some Christian therapies that emphasize self-reliance, the Bible directs believers to rely on Jehovah’s provision and timing, freeing them from worldly fears and ensuring spiritual strength."

    ],
    "D": "Apostasy is willful rebellion against Jehovah’s truth after knowing it. 2 Thessalonians 2:3 prophesies a great apostasy before the end, fulfilled by false Christianity. Hebrews 6:6 warns of the impossibility of renewing unrepentant apostates. Unlike liberal churches that tolerate doctrinal deviation, the Bible demands loyalty to Jehovah’s standards, condemning those who promote false teachings like the Trinity or interfaith, ensuring true worship remains pure."

    ],
    "D": "Apostolic succession, as claimed by Catholicism, is a false doctrine, as the Bible shows no unbroken line of authority from the apostles. Acts 20:29, 30 warns of corrupt men arising within the congregation, twisting truth. 2 Timothy 4:3 predicts rejection of sound teaching, fulfilled by the clergy’s rise. Unlike Catholic claims of papal authority, the Bible vests authority in God’s Word and Christ’s headship, guiding true Christians through Jehovah’s organization."

    ],
    "D": "Appearance must reflect modesty and godliness, honoring Jehovah. 1 Timothy 2:9 commands modest dress, avoiding extravagance. 1 Samuel 16:7 emphasizes Jehovah’s focus on the heart, not outward show. Unlike worldly religions or fashion-driven churches that prioritize external appeal, the Bible stresses inner qualities, ensuring appearance aligns with worship and does not distract from Jehovah’s glory."

      "Zephaniah 3:8 - <em>My decision is to gather nations... to pour out upon them my indignation.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Armageddon is Jehovah’s war to destroy Satan’s system, cleansing the earth for His Kingdom. Revelation 16:16 identifies the battleground of divine judgment. Matthew 24:21 describes an unparalleled tribulation, ending wickedness. Zephaniah 3:8 shows Jehovah’s indignation against nations. Unlike evangelical views of Armageddon as a human or symbolic conflict, the Bible presents it as Jehovah’s precise judgment, sparing only His loyal servants for a paradise earth."

    ],
    "D": "Atonement is Jehovah’s provision through Jesus’ ransom to reconcile mankind to Him. Romans 5:11 highlights reconciliation via Christ’s sacrifice. Hebrews 9:28 shows Jesus’ death covers sins once for all. Unlike Catholic teachings of ongoing sacrifices in the Mass or Hindu concepts of karma, the Bible teaches one perfect sacrifice suffices, offering forgiveness and life to those exercising faith in Jehovah’s arrangement."

    ],
    "D": "Authority is ordained by Jehovah for order and worship. Romans 13:1 commands subjection to secular authorities, as they exist by God’s permission. Hebrews 13:17 urges obedience to congregation leaders. Unlike rebellious attitudes in some Protestant groups or secular defiance, the Bible teaches respect for authority, balanced by prioritizing Jehovah’s laws when conflicts arise (Acts 5:29), ensuring harmony in His organization."

    ],
    "D": "Babylon the Great is the world empire of false religion, opposing Jehovah. Revelation 17:5 identifies her as a harlot, symbolizing spiritual adultery. Revelation 18:4 calls God’s people to flee her to avoid judgment. Unlike Catholic claims of being the true church or interfaith movements embracing all religions, the Bible condemns Babylon’s doctrines, like the Trinity and immortality of the soul, as Satanic, destined for destruction at Armageddon."

      "Acts 2:38 - <em>Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Baptism requires full submersion in water, symbolizing dedication to Jehovah after repentance and faith. Matthew 28:19 commands baptizing disciples, and Mark 1:10 confirms Jesus was fully submerged, setting the pattern. Acts 2:38 ties baptism to forgiveness through Christ. Unlike Catholic or Protestant practices of sprinkling or infant baptism, which lack biblical support, the Bible requires conscious dedication by immersion, rejecting infant baptism as invalid since babies cannot repent or choose Jehovah’s service."

    ],
    "D": "Bible study is essential for knowing Jehovah and gaining life. 2 Timothy 2:15 urges diligent study to handle God’s Word accurately. Acts 17:11 commends examining scriptures daily for truth. Unlike superficial reading in many churches or reliance on clergy, the Bible demands personal effort to understand Jehovah’s purpose, equipping believers to teach others and resist false doctrines like the Trinity or evolution."

    ],
    "D": "Accurate Bible translation conveys Jehovah’s truth clearly. Nehemiah 8:8 shows the need for clear, understandable scripture. Psalm 119:160 affirms God’s Word as truth, requiring faithful rendering. Unlike many translations, like the King James Version, which retain errors or Trinitarian bias, the New World Translation restores Jehovah’s name and clarifies doctrines, countering distortions in Catholic and Protestant Bibles that obscure truths like the soul’s mortality."

      "Mark 7:7 - <em>It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Birthdays are not celebrated, as they lack biblical approval and stem from pagan origins. Ecclesiastes 7:1 prioritizes a good name over birth, and no Bible account shows God’s servants celebrating birthdays. Mark 7:7 condemns man-made traditions. Unlike Catholic or secular practices that honor birthdays, linked to astrology and idolatry in ancient cultures, the Bible directs worship to Jehovah, avoiding rituals that glorify self."

      "Genesis 9:4 - <em>Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Blood is sacred, representing life, and Jehovah commands abstaining from it. Leviticus 17:14 and Genesis 9:4 prohibit consuming blood, a law reaffirmed in Acts 15:29 for Christians, including medical transfusions. Unlike some denominations that allow transfusions, citing medical need, the Bible’s command is absolute, requiring faith in Jehovah’s provision. This obedience distinguishes true worship, honoring God’s sovereignty over life."

    ],
    "D": "Being born again applies to the 144,000 anointed with a heavenly hope, receiving a spiritual rebirth. John 3:3 links it to seeing God’s Kingdom as rulers. 1 Peter 1:23 ties it to God’s Word and spirit. Unlike evangelical claims that all Christians are born again for heaven, the Bible restricts this to the anointed, while others inherit earth. This refutes mass heavenly callings, clarifying Jehovah’s purpose for two hopes."

    ],
    "D": "Children are Jehovah’s gift, to be raised in His truth. Psalm 127:3 calls them an inheritance, entrusted to parents. Ephesians 6:4 commands nurturing them in Jehovah’s discipline, fostering faith. Unlike permissive parenting in secular or some Christian circles, the Bible demands active spiritual training, protecting children from Satan’s world and preparing them for eternal life in Jehovah’s Kingdom."

      "Colossians 2:8 - <em>Look out that no one takes you captive by means of the philosophy and empty deception.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Christmas is a pagan holiday, not celebrated by true Christians. Jeremiah 10:2-4 condemns customs like decorating trees, linked to idolatry. Colossians 2:8 warns against human traditions. Unlike Catholic and Protestant observance of Christmas, rooted in Saturnalia and false December 25 dating, the Bible gives no date for Jesus’ birth and commands pure worship, free from pagan rituals."

    ],
    "D": "Compassion reflects Jehovah’s mercy, a quality His servants must show. Colossians 3:12 commands clothing oneself with compassion, aiding others. Luke 6:36 urges imitating Jehovah’s mercy. Unlike cold legalism in some religious sects or secular indifference, the Bible demands active kindness, as Jesus showed, strengthening unity and drawing others to Jehovah’s truth for salvation."

      "James 5:16 - <em>Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Confession of sins to Jehovah ensures forgiveness through Jesus’ ransom. 1 John 1:9 promises forgiveness for confessed sins. James 5:16 encourages confessing to elders for spiritual help. Unlike Catholic confession to priests, which assumes human mediators, the Bible directs confession primarily to Jehovah, with elders aiding restoration, maintaining a clean congregation."

    ],
    "D": "The congregation is Jehovah’s arrangement for worship and support. Hebrews 10:25 urges regular meetings for encouragement. Acts 20:28 shows elders shepherd the flock. Unlike independent churches or Catholic hierarchies, the Bible organizes congregations under Christ’s headship, guided by elders, fostering unity and spiritual growth for Jehovah’s service."

      "Acts 24:16 - <em>I strive to have a clear conscience toward God and men.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "A Bible-trained conscience guides decisions to please Jehovah. Romans 14:22 emphasizes personal accountability in faith. 1 Timothy 1:19 links conscience to spiritual health, and Acts 24:16 reflects maintaining it before God and men. Unlike relativistic views in liberal Christianity or secular ethics, the Bible demands a conscience molded by Jehovah’s standards, ensuring integrity and protection from Satan’s influence."

    ],
    "D": "Courage is vital for serving Jehovah amidst opposition. Deuteronomy 31:6 assures God’s support, inspiring boldness. 1 Corinthians 16:13 urges standing firm in faith. Unlike cowardly compromise in some religions, the Bible demands steadfastness, as shown by early Christians, enabling believers to preach and endure persecution for Jehovah’s name."

      "Revelation 4:11 - <em>You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory... because you created all things.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Jehovah created all things, as Genesis 1:1 declares. Psalm 19:1 shows creation’s glory reflects His power, and Revelation 4:11 affirms His worthiness as Creator. Unlike evolutionary theories in secular science or liberal churches, which deny purposeful design, the Bible’s account of creation reveals Jehovah’s orderly plan, culminating in a paradise earth for His worshippers."

      "Galatians 3:13 - <em>Christ became a curse for us.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Jesus died on a torture stake, not a cross, as John 19:17 indicates. Deuteronomy 21:22, 23 and Galatians 3:13 link a stake to a curse, fulfilled by Jesus’ death. Unlike Catholic and Protestant use of the cross, a pagan symbol adopted from ancient religions like Egyptian worship, the Bible uses ‘stauros’ (stake), rejecting idolatrous symbols in true worship of Jehovah."

    ],
    "D": "Biblical chronology, such as the 1914 establishment of God’s Kingdom, is rooted in prophecy. Daniel 4:17, with the ‘seven times,’ calculates to 1914 from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 B.C.E. Luke 21:24 marks the end of Gentile times, signaling Christ’s reign. Unlike speculative date-setting by groups like Seventh-day Adventists or dispensationalists, who misapply prophecies, the Bible provides precise timelines through Jehovah’s Word, guiding true worshippers to recognize the last days and prepare for Armageddon."

      "John 11:25 - <em>I am the resurrection and the life.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Death is the cessation of life, resulting from sin inherited from Adam. Ecclesiastes 9:5 confirms the dead are unconscious, awaiting resurrection. Romans 6:23 identifies death as sin’s penalty, countered by Jesus’ ransom. John 11:25 promises resurrection through Christ. Unlike Catholic and Protestant beliefs in an immortal soul or hellfire, which stem from pagan Greek philosophy, the Bible teaches death is a sleep, with hope in Jehovah’s restoration to life in a paradise earth."

      "Revelation 12:9 - <em>The great dragon was hurled down... called the Devil and Satan.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Demons are fallen angels under Satan, opposing Jehovah’s purpose. Ephesians 6:12 describes them as wicked spirit forces influencing mankind. James 4:7 urges resistance to their schemes, and Revelation 12:9 links them to Satan’s rebellion. Unlike occult practices in spiritism or New Age beliefs that view spirits as benevolent, the Bible condemns demonic influence, evident in false religions and immorality, requiring Jehovah’s protection to resist their deception."

      "Psalm 94:12 - <em>Happy is the man whom you discipline, O Jehovah.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Discipline from Jehovah corrects and strengthens His servants, reflecting His love. Hebrews 12:6 shows it guides them to righteousness. Proverbs 3:11 urges acceptance, and Psalm 94:12 highlights its blessings. Unlike permissive attitudes in some Christian denominations or secular parenting, the Bible views discipline—through scripture, elders, or trials—as essential for spiritual growth, preparing worshippers for eternal life in Jehovah’s Kingdom."

      "Matthew 19:9 - <em>Whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Jehovah hates divorce, viewing marriage as sacred. Malachi 2:16 expresses His disapproval, while Matthew 19:9 permits divorce only for sexual immorality. Unlike liberal Christian or secular views that allow divorce for any reason, the Bible upholds marriage’s permanence, requiring fidelity and effort to preserve it. Divorce outside biblical grounds disrupts Jehovah’s arrangement, endangering spiritual standing and family unity."

    "D": "Dreams are generally unreliable, as Ecclesiastes 5:7 warns against their vanity. Joel 2:28 applied to prophetic dreams in apostolic times, not today. Unlike mystical beliefs in some African or Eastern religions that view dreams as divine messages, the Bible shows Jehovah now communicates through His Word and organization, not dreams, protecting His servants from deception by Satan or imagination."

    ],
    "D": "Recreational drug use is condemned as druggery, a work of the flesh. Galatians 5:20 lists it among sins barring entry to God’s Kingdom. 2 Corinthians 7:1 urges cleansing from defilement, including drug abuse. Unlike secular or some liberal Christian tolerance of drugs, the Bible demands a clean body and mind, as Jehovah’s temple, ensuring worshippers honor Him and avoid Satan’s traps."

      "Revelation 21:1 - <em>I saw a new heaven and a new earth.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Jehovah created the earth for mankind to inhabit forever. Psalm 115:16 assigns it to humans, and Isaiah 45:18 confirms its purpose. Revelation 21:1 promises a renewed earth under God’s Kingdom. Unlike rapture beliefs in evangelical Christianity, which claim the earth will be destroyed, the Bible teaches it will be transformed into a paradise for the righteous, fulfilling Jehovah’s original purpose."

    ],
    "D": "Easter is a pagan holiday, not celebrated by true Christians. Acts 12:4 (mistranslated as ‘Easter’ in some Bibles) refers to Passover, a Jewish observance. Colossians 2:8 warns against human traditions. Unlike Catholic and Protestant Easter, rooted in fertility goddess worship (e.g., Eostre), the Bible commands commemorating Jesus’ death, not his resurrection, through the Memorial, rejecting pagan rituals."

    ],
    "D": "True education begins with knowing Jehovah through His Word. Proverbs 1:7 establishes reverence for God as knowledge’s foundation. 2 Timothy 2:15 urges diligent Bible study, and Psalm 119:105 shows scripture guides life.

    "D": "Elders are appointed men who shepherd Jehovah’s congregation. Titus 1:5 and 1 Timothy 3:2 outline their role and qualifications, requiring exemplary conduct. Acts 20:28 tasks them with protecting the flock.

    ],
    "D": "Encouragement strengthens Jehovah’s people to endure. Hebrews 10:24, 25 urges inciting love through meetings, and 1 Thessalonians 5:11 calls for building each other up.

    "D": "Endurance in faith ensures salvation amidst trials. James 1:12 blesses those enduring, and Matthew 24:13 promises salvation for perseverance. Hebrews 12:1 likens it to a race.

Romans 1:20 shows creation reveals His qualities.

    "D": "Fear of Jehovah is reverential awe, leading to wisdom and obedience. Proverbs 9:10 and Psalm 111:10 link it to understanding, and Deuteronomy 10:12 makes it a core requirement.

    "D": "Human governments are permitted by Jehovah but are temporary. Romans 13:1 commands subjection to authorities, yet John 17:16 shows Christians remain neutral. Daniel 2:44 prophesies God’s Kingdom destroying human rule.

Matthew 24:21 and Daniel 12:1 describe its unprecedented severity, and Revelation 7:14 shows a great crowd surviving.

Proverbs 16:20 emphasizes trust in Jehovah. Unlike secular pursuits of wealth or pleasure, or Buddhist detachment, the Bible shows happiness stems from a relationship with Jehovah, studying His Word, and anticipating His Kingdom, which will bring everlasting joy in paradise."

    ],
    "D": "Heaven is Jehovah’s spiritual realm, reserved for the 144,000 anointed to rule with Christ. Revelation 14:1 identifies this limited group, and John 14:2 confirms their heavenly dwelling. Psalm 115:16 assigns earth to mankind. Unlike evangelical beliefs that all Christians go to heaven, the Bible restricts heaven to the anointed, while the majority inherit a paradise earth, refuting mass heavenly hope and aligning with Jehovah’s purpose."

    ],
    "D": "Hell, or the grave, is a state of unconsciousness, not eternal torment. Ecclesiastes 9:10 and Psalm 146:4 show the dead have no activity or thoughts. Revelation 20:14 symbolizes the grave’s destruction. Unlike Catholic and Protestant hellfire doctrines, rooted in pagan myths, the Bible teaches death is a sleep, with resurrection as the hope, exposing torment teachings as Satanic lies that misrepresent Jehovah’s justice."

    "D": "Holidays like Christmas and Easter are pagan, rejected by Jehovah. Colossians 2:8 and Jeremiah 10:2 warn against human traditions, and Mark 7:7 condemns man-made worship. Unlike Catholic and Protestant celebration of holidays with pagan roots (e.g., Saturnalia, Eostre), the Bible commands pure worship, free from idolatry, directing believers to commemorate only Jesus’ death, ensuring devotion to Jehovah alone."

      "Psalm 104:30 - <em>You send out your spirit, they are created.</em>"
    ],
    "D": "Holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person. Acts 1:8 shows it empowers believers, John 14:26 describes it as a helper, and Psalm 104:30 links it to creation. Unlike Trinitarian teachings in Catholicism and Protestantism, which falsely claim the spirit is a third person of a godhead, the Bible presents it as Jehovah’s power, used to accomplish His will, guiding and strengthening His servants."

    ],
    "D": "Homosexuality is a sin, condemned by Jehovah as unnatural. Romans 1:26, 27 and Leviticus 18:22 prohibit same-sex relations, and 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10 bars practitioners from God’s Kingdom. Unlike liberal churches or secular views that normalize homosexuality, the Bible upholds Jehovah’s design for marriage between man and woman, requiring repentance and change for salvation."

    "D": "Honesty is essential for Jehovah’s worshippers, reflecting His truthfulness. Proverbs 12:22 and Ephesians 4:25 demand truth, and Hebrews 13:18 urges honest conduct.

    "D": "Hope is the confident expectation of Jehovah’s promises, including paradise. Romans 15:13 ties hope to joy, Revelation 21:4 to a world without death, and Psalm 37:29 to an earthly inheritance.

    "D": "Humility is vital for pleasing Jehovah, marked by submission to His will. Micah 6:8 and Philippians 2:3 call for humble conduct, and James 4:10 promises exaltation.

Ecclesiastes 9:11 shows life’s outcomes are not governed by chance, and Isaiah 65:11 condemns worshipping luck deities. Proverbs 16:33 attributes all outcomes to Jehovah’s will.

Luke 22:19 and 1 Corinthians 11:25 institute the Memorial, a simple remembrance, not a sacrificial rite.

    ],
    "D": "Modesty in dress and conduct honors Jehovah. 1 Timothy 2:9 and 1 Peter 3:3-4 emphasize inner beauty over outward show, and Proverbs 11:22 values discretion.
