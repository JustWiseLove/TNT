            <p>The Bible’s accurate teachings form the foundation of true worship guiding Jehovah’s Witnesses to honor Jehovah follow Jesus and prepare for His Kingdom. These truths proven by Scripture and practice lead to everlasting life.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Jehovah the Only True God</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah is the only true God identified by His name as Psalm 83:18 declares. Jesus His Son is subordinate sent to reveal Jehovah’s will (John 3:16). Unlike false gods Jehovah’s sovereignty is proven by His creation and prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses honor His name in 240+ lands distinguishing true worship from idolatry.</p><br><p><em>“That men may know that you whose name is Jehovah you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Holy Spirit as God’s Active Force</strong></p><br><p>The Holy Spirit is Jehovah’s active force not a person used to inspire prophets and empower disciples (Acts 2:17). Unlike false views of a triune God Scripture shows it as God’s power like wind or fire guiding true worshipers. Jehovah’s Witnesses rely on this force to preach and live morally.</p><br><p><em>“I will pour out my spirit on all sorts of flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” — Acts 2:17</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>God’s Kingdom and Its Rulers</strong></p><br><p>God’s Kingdom a heavenly government will restore earth under Christ (Daniel 2:44). The New Covenant selects 144000 anointed ones to rule as kings and priests (Luke 22:20; Revelation 14:1). This hope fulfilled since 1914 drives true worshipers to preach unlike human governments that fail.</p><br><p><em>“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” — Daniel 2:44</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Death and Resurrection</strong></p><br><p>The dead are unconscious awaiting resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to earth or heaven (John 5:28-29). Unlike false afterlife myths this truth comforts true worshipers as Jehovah’s Witnesses teach globally offering hope based on God’s justice.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” — John 5:28-29</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Free Will and Moral Living</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah grants free will allowing humans to choose obedience (Deuteronomy 30:19). True worshipers like Jehovah’s Witnesses live simply avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:8). This contrasts with false teachings of fate or greed as the Bible’s moral guidance promotes peace and health.</p><br><p><em>“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” — Deuteronomy 30:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Memorial of Christ’s Death</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate Jesus’ death annually on Nisan 14 following his command (1 Corinthians 11:24). This simple ceremony—bread wine prayers—honors his ransom unlike pagan festivals. In 2024 over 20 million attended globally proving true worship’s devotion to Christ.</p><br><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — 1 Corinthians 11:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Global Preaching and Unity</strong></p><br><p>True worshipers preach the Kingdom globally (Matthew 24:14) as Jehovah’s Witnesses do in 1000+ languages. Their unity with identical beliefs in 120000 congregations reflects God’s spirit (Psalm 133:1). Unlike divided religions this accuracy shows Jehovah’s blessing on true worship.</p><br><p><em>“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” — Matthew 24:14</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Bible’s Reliability and Discipline</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s accuracy—scientific (Isaiah 40:22) historical (2 Kings 20:20) prophetic (Ezekiel 26:12)—guides true worship (Psalm 119:160). Baptism follows dedicated study (Acts 8:36) and discipline keeps congregations clean (1 Corinthians 5:13). Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold these truths unlike false religions.</p>

            <p>False teachings blaspheme Jehovah’s sovereignty, spreading lies that mislead billions with pagan rituals and doctrines. True worshipers reject these deceptions to honor Jehovah purely, avoiding the spiritual harm of false worship.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Trinity and False Gods</strong></p><br><p>The Trinity doctrine, formalized at Nicaea (325 CE), falsely claims Jehovah, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are one God, mimicking Babylonian triads (2000 BCE). Scripture declares one true God (1 Corinthians 8:6). This lie blasphemes Jehovah’s unique sovereignty, misleading billions in false worship.</p><br><p><em>“There is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are.” — 1 Corinthians 8:6</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Hellfire and Immortal Soul</strong></p><br><p>Hellfire, rooted in Greek Hades (800 BCE), claims eternal torment, and the immortal soul myth, from Egyptian ka beliefs (3000 BCE), denies death’s unconsciousness (Psalm 146:4). These lies misrepresent Jehovah’s justice, scaring people from true worship, unlike the Bible’s resurrection hope.</p><br><p><em>“His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.” — Psalm 146:4</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Karma and Fate</strong></p><br><p>Karma, from Hindu Vedas (1500 BCE), claims cosmic reward/punishment, and fate, from Chaldean astrology (2000 BCE), denies free will. Both contradict Jehovah’s gift of choice (Joshua 24:15). These lies blaspheme His sovereignty, trapping people in false destinies.</p><br><p><em>“Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.” — Joshua 24:15</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christmas and Easter</strong></p><br><p>Christmas, tied to Roman Saturnalia (200 BCE), honors sun gods with trees and lights, and Easter, from Saxon Eostre (700 CE), uses fertility symbols (eggs, rabbits). These pagan festivals (Isaiah 42:8) blaspheme Jehovah by blending idolatry with Jesus’ name, unlike true worship’s simplicity.</p><br><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name; I give my glory to no one else.” — Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Birthdays and Astrology</strong></p><br><p>Birthdays, linked to Egyptian pharaoh cults (2600 BCE), glorify self, and astrology, from Chaldean star charts (2000 BCE), predicts fate (Deuteronomy 18:10). These practices blaspheme Jehovah’s purpose (Psalm 36:9), diverting worshipers from His truth with pagan rituals.</p><br><p><em>“With you is the source of life; by your light we see light.” — Psalm 36:9</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Prosperity Gospel and Clergy Hypocrisy</strong></p><br><p>The prosperity gospel, from 1900s televangelists, falsely promises wealth as God’s will (Matthew 6:24), and hypocritical clergy, like Pharisees, preach but live immorally (Matthew 23:3). These lies exploit followers, blaspheming Jehovah’s generosity and justice.</p><br><p><em>“You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” — Matthew 6:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Evolution and Interfaith Compromise</strong></p><br><p>Evolution, from Darwin (1859), denies Jehovah’s creation (Genesis 1:27), and interfaith movements, since the 20th century, equate false gods with Jehovah (Deuteronomy 4:39). These lies blaspheme His role as Creator and sovereign, misleading people from true worship.</p><br><p><em>“God created man in his image.” — Genesis 1:27</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Non-Biblical Books and Ancestor Worship</strong></p><br><p>Non-biblical texts like the Quran or Vedas (Psalm 119:105), ancestor worship in Voodoo (Isaiah 8:19), and the cross symbol from Tammuz cults (Deuteronomy 4:16) contradict Scripture. These lies blaspheme Jehovah’s truth, promoting idolatry over pure worship.</p><br><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105</em></p>

    D: `
        <p>Discernment is the spiritual skill to distinguish true worship, approved by Jehovah, from false worship promoted by Satan. Through Bible study, prayer, and careful observation, Jehovah’s Witnesses develop this ability to navigate deception and honor Jehovah purely, preparing for everlasting life in His Kingdom.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Testing Teachings with Scripture</strong></p><br><p>Discernment begins by comparing every teaching to the Bible, as the Bereans did when they “examined the Scriptures daily” to verify Paul’s message. A teaching must align with Jehovah’s sovereignty and Jesus’ role as the truth. For example, does it uphold Jehovah as the only true God, or does it add human rules? True worship relies on Scripture alone, while false worship introduces traditions or philosophies that contradict God’s Word. To grow in discernment, study the Bible regularly to ensure your beliefs match its clear standards.</p><br><p><em>“They examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” — Acts 17:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Recognizing Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>True worship centers on Jehovah’s name, which He declared as His memorial forever. Discernment involves checking if a religion boldly uses “Jehovah” in its teachings and prayers, as Jesus did when teaching his followers. Many religions replace Jehovah’s name with titles like “Lord” or “God,” obscuring His identity. This is a key sign of false worship. To sharpen discernment, notice whether a faith honors Jehovah’s name in its publications, songs, and preaching, reflecting its commitment to true worship.</p><br><p><em>“This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered.” — Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Spotting Pagan Influences</strong></p><br><p>Discernment helps identify pagan influences in worship, which Jehovah commands His people to avoid. Look for rituals, symbols, or festivals not found in the Bible, such as those tied to ancient idol worship. For example, does a religion use images or celebrate holidays with roots outside Scripture? True worship, as practiced by Jehovah’s Witnesses, remains free of such traditions, relying solely on God’s Word. To develop this skill, research the origins of religious practices and compare them to Jehovah’s standards for pure worship.</p><br><p><em>“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves, says Jehovah, and quit touching the unclean thing.” — 2 Corinthians 6:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Evaluating Global Unity</strong></p><br><p>True worshipers are united worldwide, sharing the same beliefs and practices, as Jehovah desires. Discernment involves evaluating whether a religion demonstrates this unity across nations or is divided by conflicting doctrines. Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, teach the same Bible truths in every country, reflecting God’s spirit. In contrast, false worship often shows division, with differing beliefs or practices. To grow in discernment, observe a religion’s consistency in its teachings and love among its members.</p><br><p><em>“How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” — Psalm 133:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Strengthening Discernment Through Study</strong></p><br><p>Regular Bible study sharpens discernment, training worshipers to distinguish right from wrong. By using tools like the New World Translation and Watchtower Library, Jehovah’s Witnesses verify teachings against Scripture, building spiritual maturity. False worship relies on human traditions or vague ideas, but true worshipers study diligently to understand Jehovah’s will. To develop this skill, set aside time daily to read the Bible, reflect on its principles, and discuss its truths with others, ensuring your faith rests on solid truth.</p><br><p><em>“Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” — Hebrews 5:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Praying for Wisdom</strong></p><br><p>Discernment grows through heartfelt prayer to Jehovah, asking for wisdom to see truth clearly. Jesus set the example by praying for guidance during trials, relying on his Father’s direction. When faced with religious claims, pray to understand whether they align with Jehovah’s purpose. False worship lacks this reliance on God, but true worshipers trust Jehovah to guide them. To strengthen discernment, pray regularly, especially when making spiritual decisions, and trust Jehovah to reveal the right path.</p><br><p><em>“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all.” — James 1:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Observing Fruits of Worship</strong></p><br><p>Discernment involves examining a religion’s fruits, or results, to see if they reflect Jehovah’s blessing. Jesus taught that true worshipers produce good fruits, such as love, peace, and obedience to God’s commands. For example, Jehovah’s Witnesses show love through their global preaching and neutrality in conflicts. Religions marked by greed, division, or violence reveal false worship. To sharpen this skill, look at a faith’s actions—does it promote Jehovah’s standards or worldly values?</p><br><p><em>“By their fruits you will recognize them.” — Matthew 7:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Choosing the Narrow Path</strong></p><br><p>Discernment leads to the “narrow” path of true worship, which Jesus said few find. This path involves obeying Jehovah’s commands and rejecting popular but false religions. Check if a faith follows Jesus’ example of loyalty to Jehovah alone, as Jehovah’s Witnesses do by prioritizing Scripture over human traditions. False worship often appeals to the masses but leads to destruction. To develop discernment, choose beliefs that align with the Bible’s truth, even if they require sacrifice, for they lead to everlasting life.</p><br><p><em>“Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading to destruction.” — Matthew 7:13</em></p>

        <p>Through endurance, Jehovah’s Witnesses faithfully share Bible truths, trusting in God’s power to make their efforts grow, as they teach about His Kingdom and its blessings for mankind.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Current Events Signal Change</strong></p><p>Current events and attitudes indicate a change is near, with wars, food shortages, earthquakes, and moral decline fulfilling Bible prophecy (Matthew 24:3, 7, 8; Luke 21:10, 11; 2 Timothy 3:1-5). These are signs of the last days, urging endurance in preaching Jehovah’s Kingdom as the solution.</p><p><em>“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.” — Matthew 24:7, 8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Earth Will Never Be Destroyed</strong></p><p>The earth will never be destroyed, as Jehovah established it to remain forever (Psalm 104:5; Ecclesiastes 1:4). True worshipers endure in teaching this hope, trusting in God’s promise for a lasting home for the righteous.</p><p><em>“He has established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved from its place forever and ever.” — Psalm 104:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Earth’s Environment Restored</strong></p><p>The earth’s environment will be restored to paradise conditions under God’s Kingdom (Isaiah 35:1, 2; Revelation 11:18). Jehovah’s Witnesses endure in sharing this promise of a renewed earth, free from ruin and filled with beauty.</p><p><em>“The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.” — Isaiah 35:1, 2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Perfect Health for All</strong></p><p>Everyone will enjoy perfect health under God’s Kingdom, with no sickness or disability (Isaiah 33:24; 35:5, 6). This hope motivates endurance in teaching about Jehovah’s provision for eternal well-being.</p><p><em>“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’ The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.” — Isaiah 33:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Live Forever on Earth</strong></p><p>The righteous will live forever on a paradise earth, inheriting it as God’s gift (Psalm 37:29; Matthew 5:5).

        <br><p><strong>Husbands Love Your Wives</strong></p><p>A husband should love his wife as himself, fostering a strong family bond (Ephesians 5:33; Colossians 3:19). Jehovah’s Witnesses endure in teaching biblical family values that honor Jehovah’s arrangement for marriage.</p><p><em>“Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself.” — Ephesians 5:33</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Wives Respect Your Husbands</strong></p><p>A wife should deeply respect her husband, supporting the family’s spiritual unity (Ephesians 5:33; Colossians 3:18). Endurance in upholding this principle strengthens marriages in harmony with Jehovah’s will.</p><p><em>“You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.” — Colossians 3:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Loyalty in Marriage</strong></p><p>A husband and wife should be loyal to each other, honoring Jehovah’s view of marriage (Malachi 2:16; Matthew 19:4-6, 9; Hebrews 13:4). Teaching this truth requires endurance to counter worldly views that undermine marital fidelity.</p><p><em>“Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement.” — Hebrews 13:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Children Obey Your Parents</strong></p><p>Children who respect and obey their parents will succeed, as this pleases Jehovah (Proverbs 1:8, 9; Ephesians 6:1-3). Endurance in teaching this builds strong families grounded in biblical principles.</p><p><em>“Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous.” — Ephesians 6:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Has a Name</strong></p><p>God’s name is Jehovah, and true worshipers use it with reverence (Psalm 83:18; Jeremiah 10:10). Enduring in proclaiming His name sets true worship apart from false religions that obscure it.</p><p><em>“May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Communicates Through Scripture</strong></p><p>Jehovah communicates with us through His inspired Word, guiding true worship (2 Timothy 3:16, 17; 2 Peter 1:20, 21).

        <br><p><strong>God Is Fair and Unbiased</strong></p><p>Jehovah is impartial, accepting all who fear Him and do right (Deuteronomy 10:17; Acts 10:34, 35). Enduring in sharing this truth invites people of all nations to worship the true God.</p><p><em>“God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” — Acts 10:34, 35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Helps Us</strong></p><p>Jehovah is a refuge, ready to help in times of distress (Psalm 46:1; 145:18, 19). Endurance in teaching this truth comforts those facing trials, pointing them to God’s support.</p><p><em>“God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress.” — Psalm 46:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pray to Jehovah</strong></p><p>Jehovah invites us to pray to Him, offering a refuge for our hearts (Psalm 62:8; 65:2; 1 Peter 5:7). Endurance in teaching prayer strengthens faith in Jehovah’s care and guidance.</p><p><em>“Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before him.” — Psalm 62:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>How to Pray</strong></p><p>The Bible teaches us how to pray meaningfully, as Jesus showed (Matthew 6:7-13; Luke 11:1-4). Enduring in sharing this guidance helps people draw close to Jehovah through proper prayer.</p><p><em>“You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.’” — Matthew 6:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pray Often</strong></p><p>We should pray constantly to stay close to Jehovah (Matthew 7:7, 8; 1 Thessalonians 5:17).

        <br><p><strong>Dead Are Unconscious</strong></p><p>The dead are unconscious, not suffering in any form (Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11-14). Endurance in teaching this biblical truth counters false afterlife beliefs.</p><p><em>“The dead know nothing at all.” — Ecclesiastes 9:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Dead Cannot Help or Harm</strong></p><p>The dead have no power to help or harm the living (Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:6, 10).

        <br><p><strong>God Hates Hypocrisy</strong></p><p>Jehovah despises hypocrisy in worship, demanding genuine devotion (Isaiah 29:13; Micah 3:11; Mark 7:6-8).

        <br><p><strong>Abel, Enoch, Noah: First Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>The earliest faithful servants, valued as treasures, witnessed for Jehovah’s righteousness in a corrupt world, proclaiming His truth with unwavering faith, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6). Abel offered a sacrifice pleasing to Jehovah, testifying to his faith through obedient worship (Genesis 4:4). His offering, made “by faith,” earned divine approval (Hebrews 11:4). Though murdered by Cain, Abel’s witness endures, as his blood “cries out” for justice (Genesis 4:10). Enoch “walked with God,” boldly prophesying against wickedness (Jude 14-15). His preaching condemned a godless generation, and Jehovah “took him” to spare him death (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5), affirming his loyalty to divine truth. Noah, a “preacher of righteousness,” built the ark and warned of the Flood for 120 years (2 Peter 2:5; Genesis 6:3). Facing ridicule, he upheld Jehovah’s laws, saving his family through faith (Hebrews 11:7). His witness stands as a testament to obedience.</p><br><p><em>“By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain.” — Hebrews 11:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: Patriarchal Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>The patriarchs, as treasured servants, established Jehovah’s covenant through unwavering faith, proclaiming His promises in a pagan world, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6). Abraham, leaving Ur at Jehovah’s call, journeyed to Canaan, offering sacrifices and declaring Jehovah’s name (Genesis 12:1-4, 7-8). His obedience, tested by nearly sacrificing Isaac, earned him the title “friend of Jehovah” (James 2:23; Hebrews 11:8-10), forging a covenant for all nations. Isaac, trusting Jehovah’s promise, remained in Canaan despite famine, receiving divine confirmation of the covenant (Genesis 26:3-5). His peaceful resolve amid conflict testified to Jehovah’s guidance, as “I am the God of Abraham your father” (Genesis 26:24). Jacob, wrestling with trials, vowed loyalty to Jehovah, erecting altars at Bethel (Genesis 28:13-15; 35:1-3). His 12 sons formed Israel’s tribes, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise to multiply his offspring, as “I am with you” (Genesis 28:15).</p><br><p><em>“I will be with you.” — Genesis 28:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Moses, Samuel, Jeremiah: Prophetic Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>Israel’s prophets, as treasured servants, proclaimed Jehovah’s name and laws, guiding His people to true devotion, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Moses, raised in Egypt, led Israel from slavery, receiving the Law at Sinai, declaring “Jehovah your God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4). He boldly confronted Pharaoh, proclaiming Jehovah’s name (Exodus 3:15), teaching Israel to worship Him alone (Exodus 20:3). Samuel, as prophet and judge, anointed Saul and David, urging Israel to serve Jehovah exclusively (1 Samuel 12:10-20). His tireless preaching strengthened devotion, as “serve Jehovah with all your heart” (1 Samuel 12:24). Jeremiah warned Judah of Babylon’s judgment, proclaiming “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). Imprisoned and mocked, he faithfully rewrote his burned scrolls (Jeremiah 36:32), testifying to Jehovah’s enduring word.</p><br><p><em>“This is my name forever.” — Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jesus, Peter, Paul: Apostolic Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>Jesus and His apostles, as priceless treasures, established Christian witnessing, proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom with steadfast faith, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Jesus declared “I have made your name known” (John 17:26), teaching Jehovah’s purpose through parables and miracles (Matthew 4:17). He preached publicly and house-to-house (Luke 8:1), enduring death on a stake to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty (Philippians 2:8). Peter, a leading apostle, preached at Pentecost, declaring Jehovah’s resurrection of Jesus (Acts 2:32-36). Imprisoned and beaten, he continued witnessing (Acts 5:42), stating “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). Paul, converted from persecutor, traveled thousands of miles, establishing congregations and writing 14 epistles (Acts 9:15). Beheaded under Nero, he proclaimed “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6).</p><br><p><em>“Go, make disciples of all the nations.” — Matthew 28:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Perpetua: Early Martyrs</strong></p><br><p>Early Christians, like treasured gems, witnessed for Jehovah amid persecution, preserving His truth, as “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10). Polycarp of Smyrna, a disciple of John, refused to honor false gods, declaring, “I am a Christian.” Burned at the stake in 155 CE, his martyrdom upheld Jehovah’s worship, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Justin Martyr, a philosopher-turned-Christian, wrote *Apologies* defending Christianity, proclaiming Jehovah as the true God. Beheaded in 165 CE, his testimony strengthened early believers. Perpetua, a young mother, faced wild beasts in Carthage’s arena in 203 CE, declaring Jehovah’s Kingdom. Her courage bolstered Christian resolve.</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” — Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Waldensians, Wycliffe, Tyndale: Reformation Translators</strong></p><br><p>Medieval and Reformation translators, as treasured servants, proclaimed Jehovah’s Word, making it accessible despite opposition, as “those seeking Jehovah will praise him” (Psalm 22:26). Waldensians, led by Peter Waldo in the 12th century, translated vernacular Bibles, sharing Jehovah’s truth with the poor. Persecuted, they hid in the Alps, proclaiming “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). John Wycliffe’s English Bible (1382) gave access to Jehovah’s Word. Declared a heretic, his bones were burned after death, but his translations spread truth, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). William Tyndale’s Pentateuch (1530) proclaimed Jehovah’s name (Exodus 6:3). Strangled and burned in 1536, his faith endured, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p><br><p><em>“Your word is truth.” — John 17:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Ainsworth, Grew, Storrs: Truth Seekers</strong></p><br><p>Early restorers, like precious treasures, proclaimed Jehovah’s truth, preparing the way for modern witnessing, as “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9). Henry Ainsworth, a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his Psalms annotations (1612), citing Psalm 83:18. Exiled for his faith, his work spread Jehovah’s name, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). Henry Grew taught Jehovah’s name and rejected false doctrines in the 1820s, facing opposition. His steadfastness reached many, as “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). George Storrs taught earthly resurrection through *Six Sermons* in the 1840s. Persecuted, his faith spread Jehovah’s truth, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p><br><p><em>“My people will know my name.” — Isaiah 52:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Russell, Rutherford, Knorr: Modern Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>Modern witnesses, as treasured servants, globalized Jehovah’s truth through faith and sacrifice, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14). Charles Taze Russell, in 1870, formed a Pittsburgh Bible study, launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* (1879) to publish truth. Distributing millions of tracts amid mob violence, he founded the Watch Tower Society (1884), proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom, as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). Joseph Franklin Rutherford, succeeding Russell in 1917, faced imprisonment in 1918 for preaching truth. Naming the group Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931, he spread Jehovah’s name via radio, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). Nathan H. Knorr, from 1942, trained missionaries through Gilead School (1943), sending them to 240 lands. His leadership expanded preaching, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><br><p><em>“I did not hold back from preaching.” — Acts 20:20</em></p>

        <p><strong>Wisdom - Foolishness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Wisdom:</strong></p><br><p>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in a way that pleases Jehovah. True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of God and leads to right decisions, clean conduct, and a meaningful life. Jehovah gives wisdom to those who ask with faith and seek his guidance in the Scriptures.</p><br><p><em>“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” — Proverbs 9:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom.” — Proverbs 4:7</em></p><br><p><em>“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God… and it will be given him.” — James 1:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Wisdom:</strong></p><br><p>Wisdom protects us from spiritual danger and helps us live in harmony with Jehovah’s principles. It strengthens our faith, improves our choices, and helps us lead others in a good way. Wise people build strong relationships and walk securely in Jehovah’s favor.</p><br><p><em>“Happy is the man who finds wisdom… It is more valuable than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.” — Proverbs 3:13, 15</em></p><br><p><em>“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“The wisdom from above is… first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey.” — James 3:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Foolishness:</strong></p><br><p>Foolishness in the Bible isn’t just about lacking knowledge—it often refers to ignoring Jehovah’s guidance and doing what is right in one’s own eyes. The foolish person acts without thought of consequences or respect for God. Such thinking is spiritually dangerous.</p><br><p><em>“The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’” — Psalm 14:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Fools despise wisdom and discipline.” — Proverbs 1:7</em></p><br><p><em>“The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.” — Ecclesiastes 10:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Foolishness:</strong></p><br><p>Foolishness can lead to sin, regret, and even spiritual ruin. It blinds a person to Jehovah’s loving direction and often results in harm to themselves and others. Jehovah encourages us to avoid the path of the foolish and walk with the wise instead.</p><br><p><em>“The wise one fears and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one remains calm.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p><br><p><em>“The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” — Proverbs 13:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Holiness - Impurity</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Holiness:</strong></p><br><p>Holiness means being clean, set apart, and loyal to Jehovah. He is the ultimate example of holiness and calls his people to reflect this quality in their lives. Being holy involves avoiding moral uncleanness, staying spiritually clean, and keeping close to Jehovah.</p><br><p><em>“You must be holy, because I am holy.” — 1 Peter 1:16</em></p><br><p><em>“Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification [holiness] without which no man will see the Lord.” — Hebrews 12:14</em></p><br><p><em>“This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Holiness:</strong></p><br><p>Holiness helps us stay close to Jehovah and reflects our deep respect for him. It protects us from harmful influences and allows us to serve him acceptably. Those who are holy will be welcomed into his clean new world, where nothing defiled will exist.</p><br><p><em>“Happy are those who are pure in heart, since they will see God.” — Matthew 5:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… in trueness.” — Psalm 145:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impurity:</strong></p><br><p>Impurity includes immoral thoughts, speech, or actions. It makes a person unclean before God and pushes them away from his favor. The Bible strongly warns against uncleanness and lists it among the behaviors that will prevent people from inheriting God’s Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“God gave them over to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts.” — Romans 1:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness… not even be mentioned among you.” — Ephesians 5:3</em></p><br><p><em>“The works of the flesh are… sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” — Galatians 5:19, 21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impurity:</strong></p><br><p>Impurity stains our conscience and can damage our relationship with Jehovah. It invites pain, guilt, and consequences. Jehovah lovingly disciplines his people to keep them clean, because he wants them to enjoy a clean conscience and a hopeful future.</p><br><p><em>“Cleanse your hearts, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” — James 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin… is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.” — 1 Corinthians 6:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Gratitude - Ingratitude</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Gratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude is a sign of humility and appreciation. Jehovah loves when we express thanks for his blessings—both big and small. Jesus often thanked his Father, and we’re encouraged to follow his example by showing thankfulness in our prayers and actions.</p><br><p><em>“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” — Psalm 107:1</em></p><br><p><em>“In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” — 1 Thessalonians 5:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Whatever you are doing… do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.” — Colossians 3:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Gratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude helps us see how much Jehovah has already done for us. It keeps us joyful and content even during trials. When we’re grateful, we’re less likely to complain or focus on what we lack. It strengthens our relationship with Jehovah and draws us closer to others.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be anxious over anything… but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” — Philippians 4:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts… and show yourselves thankful.” — Colossians 3:15</em></p><br><p><em>“Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God.” — Psalm 50:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Ingratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Ingratitude reflects a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s kindness. It’s often linked with selfishness and arrogance. The Bible warns that people in the last days would be “unthankful,” showing how serious it is in Jehovah’s eyes.</p><br><p><em>“People will be… unthankful, disloyal.” — 2 Timothy 3:2</em></p><br><p><em>“Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” — Romans 1:21</em></p><br><p><em>“You gave them a king, but in your indignation; you took him away, but in your fury.” — Hosea 13:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Ingratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Ingratitude can make us blind to Jehovah’s blessings. It leads to complaining, greed, and discontentment. Failing to thank Jehovah weakens our spirituality and can even cause us to drift away from him. A thankful heart, however, helps us remain faithful and joyful.</p><br><p><em>“How often they rebelled against him… They forgot his deeds and the wonderful works he had shown them.” — Psalm 78:40-42</em></p><br><p><em>“Guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” — Luke 12:15</em></p><br><p><em>“They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.” — Psalm 106:21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Forgiveness - Resentment</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Forgiveness:</strong></p><br><p>Forgiveness is a beautiful expression of love and mercy. Jehovah is the perfect example—he is “ready to forgive” those who repent. He also commands us to forgive others from the heart. True forgiveness brings peace and keeps bitterness out of our lives.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is merciful and compassionate… He will not always find fault, nor will he stay angry forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins.” — Psalm 103:8-10</em></p><br><p><em>“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” — Colossians 3:13</em></p><br><p><em>“If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” — Matthew 6:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Forgiveness:</strong></p><br><p>When we forgive, we imitate Jehovah. Forgiveness frees us from anger and helps relationships heal. It also keeps us in Jehovah’s favor, since he will only forgive us if we forgive others. Forgiveness shows strength—not weakness—and brings peace of mind.</p><br><p><em>“Love covers over a multitude of sins.” — 1 Peter 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” — Psalm 32:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.” — Colossians 3:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Resentment:</strong></p><br><p>Resentment is holding onto anger or bitterness, especially after being wronged. It poisons the heart and leads to hatred, division, and even revenge. The Bible warns that resentment is harmful and can separate us from God’s spirit.</p><br><p><em>“Let go of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” — Psalm 37:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not hate your brother in your heart.” — Leviticus 19:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Be wrathful, yet do not sin… Let the sun not set while you are still angry.” — Ephesians 4:26</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Resentment:</strong></p><br><p>Resentment keeps us from moving forward. It robs us of peace, damages our relationships, and makes us spiritually weak. Jehovah does not hold grudges—and neither should we. Releasing resentment allows us to be truly free and spiritually healthy.</p><br><p><em>“All bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander must be removed from you, along with all badness.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass.” — Matthew 18:33</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Loyalty - Betrayal</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Loyalty:</strong></p><br><p>Loyalty is a deep, faithful love that does not change, even in hard times. Jehovah is the perfect example of loyalty—he remains true to his promises and faithful to those who love him. In return, he expects his people to stay loyal to him, his Son, and one another.</p><br><p><em>“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, reaches to the heavens.” — Psalm 36:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” — Revelation 2:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Whoever remains loyal in a minor matter is also loyal in much.” — Luke 16:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Loyalty:</strong></p><br><p>Being loyal shows that we love Jehovah and trust him. It helps us stay firm during trials, support our spiritual family, and resist pressures from the world. Loyal friends are rare and precious, and Jehovah treasures loyal hearts.</p><br><p><em>“The eyes of Jehovah are on the faithful of the earth.” — Psalm 101:6</em></p><br><p><em>“A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” — Proverbs 17:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Love Jehovah your God with all your heart… and be loyal to him.” — Deuteronomy 30:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Betrayal:</strong></p><br><p>Betrayal breaks trust and causes deep pain. It shows selfishness and disloyalty, often for personal gain. Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus with a kiss—a tragic example of how far betrayal can go. The Bible clearly warns against this dangerous trait.</p><br><p><em>“Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted… has turned against me.” — Psalm 41:9</em></p><br><p><em>“Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!” — Mark 14:21</em></p><br><p><em>“A man lacking good sense betrays confidence.” — Proverbs 11:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Betrayal:</strong></p><br><p>Betrayal brings shame and regret, and it can destroy relationships permanently. Jehovah values loyalty, not people who switch sides or act treacherously. We should never imitate Satan, the ultimate betrayer of God’s trust.</p><br><p><em>“Traitors… have nothing to do with them.” — 2 Timothy 3:4, 5</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who slanders his neighbor is stupid.” — Proverbs 11:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests a person who causes division among brothers.” — Proverbs 6:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Obedience - Disobedience</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Obedience:</strong></p><br><p>Obedience is highly valued by Jehovah. It shows respect for his authority and love for his guidance. Even Jesus “learned obedience” during his time on earth. Obeying Jehovah leads to peace, protection, and blessings.</p><br><p><em>“To obey is better than a sacrifice.” — 1 Samuel 15:22</em></p><br><p><em>“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” — 1 John 5:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” — James 1:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Obedience:</strong></p><br><p>Obedience leads to life. When we follow Jehovah’s instructions, we show trust in his wisdom. It also keeps us safe from spiritual harm. Obedience helps us grow close to Jehovah and prepares us for future blessings in his Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Keep following the course of obedience to him, and cling to him, for he is your life.” — Deuteronomy 30:20</em></p><br><p><em>“If you listen to my commandments… I will give the rain for your land at its proper time.” — Deuteronomy 11:13-14</em></p><br><p><em>“The obedient one will eat the good things of the land.” — Isaiah 1:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Disobedience:</strong></p><br><p>Disobedience is rebellion against God’s authority. It began with Satan and led to the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible warns that those who ignore Jehovah’s laws will not receive his favor. Disobedience brings sorrow, disorder, and ultimately destruction.</p><br><p><em>“They refused to listen… and they turned a stubborn shoulder.” — Zechariah 7:11</em></p><br><p><em>“God considers vengeance on those who do not obey.” — 2 Thessalonians 1:8</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Disobedience:</strong></p><br><p>Disobedience leads us away from Jehovah’s protection. It breaks our relationship with him and opens the door to sin. Those who keep ignoring his direction will face his judgment. That’s why cultivating a spirit of obedience is vital for our spiritual survival.</p><br><p><em>“By your stubbornness… you are storing up wrath for yourself.” — Romans 2:5</em></p><br><p><em>“They stumble because they are disobedient to the word.” — 1 Peter 2:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be stiff-necked any longer, for Jehovah your God is the God of gods.” — Deuteronomy 10:16-17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Self-Control - Recklessness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Self-Control:</strong></p><br><p>Self-control is a fruit of God’s spirit. It means having the strength to resist wrong desires, control our emotions, and make wise decisions. Jehovah and Jesus both show perfect self-control. Christians are encouraged to train themselves to think clearly and act with discipline.</p><br><p><em>“God gave us… power and self-control.” — 2 Timothy 1:7</em></p><br><p><em>“Like a city broken through and left without a wall is the man who cannot control his temper.” — Proverbs 25:28</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps it under control.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Self-Control:</strong></p><br><p>Having self-control protects us from harmful choices and keeps us close to Jehovah. It helps us avoid arguments, immoral acts, and regretful words. With self-control, we can resist temptation and remain calm under pressure.</p><br><p><em>“Train yourself with godly devotion.” — 1 Timothy 4:7</em></p><br><p><em>“Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion.” — 1 Peter 5:8</em></p><br><p><em>“But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” — James 1:14-15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Recklessness:</strong></p><br><p>Recklessness is acting without thinking or care for consequences. It includes doing things impulsively, speaking without thought, or chasing selfish desires. The Bible links recklessness with foolishness and pride.</p><br><p><em>“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who talks too much will come to ruin.” — Proverbs 13:3</em></p><br><p><em>“He who hurries to be rich will not remain innocent.” — Proverbs 28:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Recklessness:</strong></p><br><p>Recklessness can lead to serious harm—for us and others. It causes bad decisions, damaged reputations, and spiritual danger. Jehovah wants us to be thoughtful and wise, not impulsive or careless. Avoiding reckless actions helps us stay faithful.</p><br><p><em>“And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.” — Ecclesiastes 4:4</em></p><br><p><em>“The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” — Proverbs 22:3</em></p><br><p><em>“A wise person acts with knowledge, but the fool exposes his stupidity.” — Proverbs 13:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Honesty - Deceit</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Honesty:</strong></p><br><p>Honesty is a core part of Jehovah’s standards. He is “a God of truth,” and he expects his servants to speak truthfully and act with integrity. Honesty builds trust, keeps our conscience clean, and brings honor to Jehovah’s name.</p><br><p><em>“Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices.” — Colossians 3:9</em></p><br><p><em>“Each of you must speak truthfully with his neighbor.” — Ephesians 4:25</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests a lying tongue, but he delights in those dealing faithfully.” — Proverbs 12:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Honesty:</strong></p><br><p>Honesty protects us from guilt and regret. It helps us maintain strong relationships and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. Even when it’s difficult, being honest shows spiritual maturity and earns the respect of others. It helps others trust us and the message we share.</p><br><p><em>“We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” — Hebrews 13:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Conduct yourselves honestly among the nations.” — 1 Peter 2:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Who may be a guest in your tent?… The one who walks faultlessly, practices what is right, and speaks the truth in his heart.” — Psalm 15:1-2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Deceit:</strong></p><br><p>Deceit, or lying, is the opposite of Jehovah’s truth. Satan is the “father of the lie” (John 8:44), and lies always lead to trouble and harm. Jehovah hates falsehood and will not allow liars to remain among his people.</p><br><p><em>“You must not steal, you must not deceive, and you must not lie to one another.” — Leviticus 19:11</em></p><br><p><em>“The one hiding hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is stupid.” — Proverbs 10:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Outside are the dogs… and all those who love and practice lying.” — Revelation 22:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Deceit:</strong></p><br><p>Lies damage trust, destroy friendships, and can even cost us our relationship with Jehovah. A dishonest life leads to spiritual ruin. That’s why the Bible tells us to “safeguard our lips” and avoid deception in all things.</p><br><p><em>“A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who lies with every breath will perish.” — Proverbs 19:9</em></p><br><p><em>“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” — John 8:32</em></p><br><p><em>“Put away lies; speak truth each one with his neighbor.” — Zechariah 8:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Peace - Conflict</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Peace:</strong></p><br><p>Peace is one of the beautiful qualities that come from Jehovah. True peace means more than just the absence of fighting—it includes harmony, calmness, and unity with others and with God. Jehovah is called the “God of peace,” and he wants his people to pursue peace in every part of their lives.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” — Psalm 29:11</em></p><br><p><em>“If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.” — Romans 12:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.” — Matthew 5:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Peace:</strong></p><br><p>Peace allows us to live calmly, make wise choices, and stay close to Jehovah. It helps us stay united with our Christian brothers and sisters. When we act as peacemakers, we imitate Jehovah and help create a peaceful atmosphere in the congregation and in our families.</p><br><p><em>“Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up.” — Romans 14:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… peace.” — Colossians 3:12, 15</em></p><br><p><em>“Those who love your law enjoy abundant peace.” — Psalm 119:165</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Conflict:</strong></p><br><p>Conflict often comes from pride, selfishness, and lack of love. It leads to division and harm. The Bible shows that stirring up arguments and fights is a sign of spiritual weakness. Jehovah does not approve of those who cause strife.</p><br><p><em>“Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers over all transgressions.” — Proverbs 10:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Where there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.” — James 3:16</em></p><br><p><em>“A man given to anger stirs up strife.” — Proverbs 29:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Conflict:</strong></p><br><p>Conflict destroys relationships, breaks down unity, and drives away Jehovah’s spirit. If we allow conflict to grow in our hearts, it can damage our spiritual health. Jehovah wants us to turn away from arguing and be quick to forgive and make peace.</p><br><p><em>“Stop being quarrelsome… be gentle toward all.” — 2 Timothy 2:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let all bitterness and anger… be removed from you.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“Anyone loving a quarrel loves transgression.” — Proverbs 17:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Patience - Impatience</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Patience:</strong></p><br><p>Patience is a key quality for true Christians. It means calmly enduring difficult situations without giving in to anger or frustration. Jehovah is described as patient, giving people time to change and respond to his guidance. When we are patient, we reflect his love and mercy.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.” — Psalm 103:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… patience.” — Colossians 3:12</em></p><br><p><em>“The end of a matter is better than its beginning; better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit.” — Ecclesiastes 7:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Patience:</strong></p><br><p>Patience helps us endure trials, get along with others, and wait for Jehovah’s promises. It protects us from saying or doing things we later regret. Developing patience helps us become mature Christians who are better equipped to face tests of faith.</p><br><p><em>“By your endurance you will preserve your lives.” — Luke 21:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” — James 1:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Love is patient and kind.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impatience:</strong></p><br><p>Impatience often leads to harsh speech, rash actions, and a lack of self-control. It can show a lack of trust in Jehovah’s timing. The Bible warns that impatient people are more likely to fall into anger or discouragement, which can harm their spiritual progress.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.” — Ecclesiastes 7:9</em></p><br><p><em>“An impatient man stirs up strife.” — Proverbs 15:18</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impatience:</strong></p><br><p>Impatience can make us act without wisdom or love. It can damage relationships and push us away from Jehovah’s ways. When we give in to impatience, we stop waiting on Jehovah and may try to take matters into our own hands.</p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good… Wait eagerly for Jehovah, and he will rescue you.” — Psalm 37:3, 34</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” — Galatians 6:9</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who trusts in Jehovah will possess the land.” — Psalm 37:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Kindness - Cruelty</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Kindness:</strong></p><br><p>Kindness is a quality that reflects Jehovah’s personality. It involves showing compassion, gentleness, and care for others, even when it’s not required. Jehovah expects his servants to be kind in speech and action, treating others with dignity and respect.</p><br><p><em>“Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.” — Ephesians 4:32</em></p><br><p><em>“But the fruitage of the spirit is… kindness.” — Galatians 5:22</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is righteous in all his ways and loyal in all his works. Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… He satisfies the desire of those who fear him.” — Psalm 145:17-19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Kindness:</strong></p><br><p>Kindness softens hearts, promotes peace, and strengthens the congregation. It draws others to the truth and shows that we are imitating Jehovah and Christ. When we are kind, even in difficult situations, we become a powerful example of true Christian love.</p><br><p><em>“A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.” — Proverbs 11:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… kindness.” — Colossians 3:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you.” — Matthew 7:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Cruelty:</strong></p><br><p>Cruelty is the opposite of Jehovah’s loving personality. It involves harshness, coldness, and intentional harm. The Bible shows that cruelty reflects a lack of mercy and love, and it causes pain to others. Jehovah disapproves of those who act with cruelty or violence.</p><br><p><em>“They sharpen their tongue like a sword; they aim their cruel words like arrows.” — Psalm 64:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one; He hates anyone who loves violence.” — Psalm 11:5</em></p><br><p><em>“The merciful one is kind to his own soul, but the cruel person brings trouble on himself.” — Proverbs 11:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Cruelty:</strong></p><br><p>Cruelty harms our relationships and damages our conscience. It makes us unlike Jehovah, who is tender and compassionate. Cruel actions and speech push others away and can destroy unity in the congregation. We must reject cruelty in all its forms to reflect God’s love.</p><br><p><em>“Remove abusive speech from your mouth.” — Colossians 3:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be removed from among you, along with all badness.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.” — Matthew 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Humility - Pride</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Humility:</strong></p><br><p>Humility is a precious quality that Jehovah loves. A humble person recognizes their need for God, does not boast, and treats others with respect. Humility allows us to accept correction, follow direction, and give glory to Jehovah instead of ourselves.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is high, but he takes note of the humble.” — Psalm 138:6</em></p><br><p><em>“He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk modestly with your God!” — Micah 6:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.” — James 4:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Humility:</strong></p><br><p>Humility helps us grow spiritually and maintain peace with others. It keeps us from becoming self-important or hard to work with. Jehovah blesses those who are humble, and Jesus himself set the perfect example of humility that we should follow.</p><br><p><em>“All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” — 1 Peter 5:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.” — Matthew 11:29</em></p><br><p><em>“For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” — Matthew 23:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Pride:</strong></p><br><p>Pride is dangerous and leads to spiritual downfall. A proud person often relies on themselves rather than Jehovah, and may look down on others. The Bible repeatedly warns that pride leads to destruction and keeps people from recognizing their need for God.</p><br><p><em>“Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” — Proverbs 16:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests everyone who is arrogant.” — Proverbs 16:5</em></p><br><p><em>“I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be profaned.” — Ezekiel 7:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Pride:</strong></p><br><p>Pride makes us unapproachable, unteachable, and distant from Jehovah. It can cause arguments, block spiritual growth, and lead to sin. Avoiding pride keeps us close to Jehovah and helps us maintain good relationships in the congregation.</p><br><p><em>“God opposes the haughty ones but gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” — James 4:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.” — Philippians 2:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Let the one who boasts, boast in Jehovah.” — 1 Corinthians 1:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Faith - Doubt</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Faith:</strong></p><br><p>Faith is essential for pleasing Jehovah. It means trusting fully in God even when we don’t see the outcome. True faith is not just belief—it’s proven by our actions. The Bible praises faithful men and women who obeyed Jehovah despite trials and uncertainty.</p><br><p><em>“Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” — Hebrews 11:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.” — Hebrews 11:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Indeed, we live by faith, not by sight.” — 2 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Faith:</strong></p><br><p>Faith keeps us strong during hard times and helps us stay close to Jehovah. It gives us courage, peace, and endurance. When we have faith, we are not shaken by doubts or fear, and we can confidently rely on Jehovah’s promises.</p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.” — Proverbs 3:5</em></p><br><p><em>“For we are saved through faith, and this not because of ourselves, it is God’s gift.” — Ephesians 2:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Fight the fine fight of the faith; get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called.” — 1 Timothy 6:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Doubt:</strong></p><br><p>Doubt can weaken our relationship with Jehovah and cause us to hesitate when we need to act with trust. The Bible shows that those who doubt are unstable and can be easily misled. Doubt is the opposite of relying on Jehovah’s wisdom.</p><br><p><em>“But let him keep asking in faith, not doubting at all, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” — James 1:6</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not out of faith. For whatever is not out of faith is sin.” — Romans 14:23</em></p><br><p><em>“You of little faith, why did you give way to doubt?” — Matthew 14:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Doubt:</strong></p><br><p>Doubt robs us of peace and confidence in Jehovah. It can lead us to rely on ourselves instead of God and may cause us to shrink back when we should move forward. Removing doubt helps us grow stronger in faith and please Jehovah more fully.</p><br><p><em>“If anyone shrinks back, I have no pleasure in him.” — Hebrews 10:38</em></p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah forever, for Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.” — Isaiah 26:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be anxious over anything… let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God… will guard your hearts and your mental powers.” — Philippians 4:6-7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Love - Hate</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Love:</strong></p><br><p>Love is the foundation of true worship and the most important quality we can show. Jehovah himself is described as love, and everything he does is motivated by it. The Bible makes it clear that love should guide all our thoughts, actions, and relationships.</p><br><p><em>“God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him.” — 1 John 4:16</em></p><br><p><em>“‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” — Matthew 22:37-39</em></p><br><p><em>“Little children, let us love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” — 1 John 3:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Love:</strong></p><br><p>Love shows we truly follow Jesus and helps us stay united with others. Without love, our faith is meaningless. Love motivates us to be kind, forgiving, and peaceable. It strengthens the congregation and reflects Jehovah’s own qualities.</p><br><p><em>“By this all will know that you are my disciples—if you have love among yourselves.” — John 13:35</em></p><br><p><em>“Above all things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” — Colossians 3:14</em></p><br><p><em>“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass… and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.” — 1 Corinthians 13:1-2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Hate:</strong></p><br><p>Hate is a harmful quality that leads to division, cruelty, and even spiritual ruin. It shows a lack of love and can damage relationships, the congregation, and our standing with Jehovah. The Bible strongly warns against hatred.</p><br><p><em>“Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.” — 1 John 3:15</em></p><br><p><em>“Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen… hatred, strife, jealousy… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” — Galatians 5:19-21</em></p><br><p><em>“Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness.” — 1 John 2:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Hate:</strong></p><br><p>Hating others blocks our relationship with Jehovah. It makes us spiritually blind and can lead to cruel actions. Jehovah himself hates unjust hatred, and if we hold onto it, we are not imitating him. Replacing hate with love protects our hearts and brings peace.</p><br><p><em>“Anyone who does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.” — 1 John 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“There are six things that Jehovah hates… a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.” — Proverbs 6:16-17</em></p><br><p><em>“He who hates his brother is in the darkness… and he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.” — 1 John 2:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Diligence - Laziness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Diligence:</strong></p><br><p>Diligence means being hardworking, dependable, and persistent—especially in our service to Jehovah. A diligent person gives their best and doesn’t give up easily. The Bible praises those who are “zealous,” “whole-souled,” and “not sluggish” in doing what is right.</p><br><p><em>“The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.” — Proverbs 21:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, and not for men.” — Colossians 3:23</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.” — Romans 12:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Diligence:</strong></p><br><p>Diligence shows that we value Jehovah’s service and the responsibilities he gives us. It brings satisfaction, helps us grow spiritually, and keeps us ready for any test of faith. Jehovah blesses the efforts of those who keep working faithfully.</p><br><p><em>“Become steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain.” — 1 Corinthians 15:58</em></p><br><p><em>“The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy one will be put to forced labor.” — Proverbs 12:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” — Galatians 6:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Laziness:</strong></p><br><p>Laziness is often connected with selfishness, lack of faith, and a poor spiritual outlook. The Bible warns that laziness leads to poverty, ruin, and spiritual sleep. A lazy person may avoid work, but in the end, it costs them more.</p><br><p><em>“The lazy one says: ‘There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the public square!’” — Proverbs 22:13</em></p><br><p><em>“The desire of the lazy will kill him, for his hands refuse to work.” — Proverbs 21:25</em></p><br><p><em>“Go to the ant, you lazy one; observe its ways and become wise.” — Proverbs 6:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Laziness:</strong></p><br><p>Laziness can damage our relationship with Jehovah, prevent growth, and make us vulnerable to temptation. It reflects spiritual carelessness. Jehovah wants us to be alert, busy in his service, and productive in our daily life.</p><br><p><em>“How long will you lie there, you lazy one? When will you rise from your sleep?” — Proverbs 6:9</em></p><br><p><em>“The one not working should not eat.” — 2 Thessalonians 3:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” — 1 Corinthians 16:13</em></p>

            <p>Jehovah’s Word, proven authentic through its inspired origins, unity, and enduring evidence, stands as the complete guide to truth, distinct from all other books.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Hebrew Scriptures Begin: Divine Origin</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s canon began around 1513 BCE with the Hebrew Scriptures, when Moses, guided by Jehovah’s spirit, wrote the first five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This date is inferred from biblical chronology and paleographic analysis of inscriptions like the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE). Jehovah Himself initiated this sacred work, inscribing the Ten Commandments on stone tablets (Exodus 31:18) and commanding Moses to record His laws (Exodus 34:27). These writings, forming the Pentateuch, established Israel’s covenant with Jehovah, reflecting divine inspiration through their harmony and fulfilled prophecy, such as the 70-year exile foretold in Jeremiah 29:10, which history confirms ended in 537 BCE with Cyrus’ decree (Ezra 1:1-4).</p><br><p>Their authenticity is evident in their focus on Jehovah’s worship, free from uninspired additions, and their preservation beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26). Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls (carbon-14 dated to 600 BCE) with “YHWH” blessings affirm their early use. Unlike other ancient texts, such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which mixes superstition with mythology, the Pentateuch’s historical accuracy and prophetic reliability set it apart, fulfilling “the saying of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p><em>“The saying of Jehovah endures forever.” — 1 Peter 1:25</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Hebrew Canon Established: Inspired Selection</strong></p><br><p>By the end of the fifth century BCE, the Hebrew canon was finalized at 39 books (or 24 in Jewish tradition), a process guided by divine inspiration through scribes like Ezra, a skilled priest (Ezra 7:6), and Nehemiah. This timeline is supported by historical records and textual analysis of the Septuagint (280 BCE). Books from Joshua to Malachi, written by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, were recognized for turning people to Jehovah’s worship, showing harmony with His purpose, and fulfilling prophecy, such as Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus 150 years before his birth, verified by the Cyrus Cylinder (circa 539 BCE).</p><br><p>Jesus and the apostles exclusively quoted these books (e.g., Matthew 11:10 citing Malachi), and no post-Malachi writings (circa 443 BCE) were included, confirming the canon’s closure without human councils. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) match later Masoretic texts, proving textual fidelity. Unlike the Apocrypha, which lacks prophetic power and contains errors (e.g., Judith’s historical inaccuracies), the Hebrew canon’s divine criteria ensure “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16) for salvation.</p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God.” — 2 Timothy 3:16</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christian Greek Scriptures Emerge: Apostolic Writings</strong></p><br><p>The Christian Greek Scriptures, adding 27 books, were written between 41 and 98 CE by apostles and disciples like Paul, John, and Luke, under holy spirit’s guidance. This timeline is based on historical evidence, such as Paul’s imprisonment (Acts 28:30, circa 61 CE), and paleographic dating of early manuscripts like the Rylands Papyrus P52 (circa 125 CE). These writings, including the Gospels and epistles, built on the Hebrew Scriptures, detailing Jesus’ life and Jehovah’s Kingdom, with fulfilled prophecies like Micah 5:2 predicting Bethlehem as Jesus’ birthplace (Matthew 2:6).</p><br><p>First-century Christians, gifted with “discernment of inspired expressions” (1 Corinthians 12:10), accepted these books, rejecting uninspired works like the Gospel of Thomas, which lacks apostolic authority and promotes Gnostic contradictions. The unity of these writings, despite authors’ diverse backgrounds—from fishermen (Peter) to physicians (Luke)—underscores their divine origin, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) with a trustworthy message.</p><br><p><em>“The word of God is alive.” — Hebrews 4:12</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christian Canon Finalized: Evidence of Completeness</strong></p><p>By the late second century CE, the Christian Greek Scriptures’ canon was finalized, totaling 66 books, as seen in early catalogs like the Muratorian Fragment (circa 170 CE) and over 5,200 Greek manuscripts. This closure followed John’s death around 98 CE, after which no new inspired writings emerged. Each book met divine criteria: turning to Jehovah’s worship, avoiding superstition, and harmonizing with the whole, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21). For example, Revelation’s prophecy of “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5) aligns with earlier scriptures on false religion.</p><br><p>Jesus’ and the apostles’ use of both testaments (e.g., Acts 15:15-18 citing Amos) confirms a consistent catalog. Early codices like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve this canon, excluding apocryphal works like the Book of Enoch, which contradicts scripture with mythical elements. This divine selection ensures “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19) in its entirety.</p><br><p><em>“We have the prophetic word made more sure.” — 2 Peter 1:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Writers’ Honesty in Admitting Failures: Uncommon Integrity</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is reinforced by its writers’ rare honesty in admitting their failures, a trait absent in most ancient texts. Moses recorded his killing of an Egyptian (Exodus 2:12), yet Jehovah used him to lead Israel. David confessed his adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah (2 Samuel 11:14-17), yet his repentance shines in Psalm 51. Peter admitted denying Jesus three times (Matthew 26:75), yet his growth is evident in 1 Peter 1:3. This transparency, spanning centuries, reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21).</p><br><p>Unlike other religious works, such as the Quran, which idealizes its figures (e.g., Muhammad’s portrayal in Surah 33:21), the Bible’s candor about human flaws demonstrates authenticity. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) and early codices preserve these accounts, showing consistency. This honesty builds trust, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) as a truthful record.</p><br><p><em>“The word of God is alive.” — Hebrews 4:12</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Diverse Authors Across Lands and Cultures: United in Truth</strong></p><p>The Bible’s 40 authors, writing over 1,600 years, spanned diverse lands and cultures yet delivered a unified message, proving its divine origin. Moses wrote in Egypt’s wilderness, David in Israel’s palaces, Jeremiah in Judah’s courts, Paul traveled from Jerusalem to Rome, and John recorded from Patmos. They included shepherds (Amos), kings (Solomon), fishermen (Peter), and a physician (Luke), using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, from 1513 BCE to 98 CE, as dated by biblical chronology and manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE).</p><br><p>Unlike fragmented texts like the Vedas, compiled over centuries with conflicting teachings, the Bible’s consistency—seen in prophecies like Daniel 9:24-27 predicting Jesus’ arrival—reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). The Dead Sea Scrolls and early codices (paleography dated 325–350 CE) confirm this unity across regions like Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Asia Minor, fulfilling “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19).</p><br><p><em>“We have the prophetic word made more sure.” — 2 Peter 1:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Distinction from Other Writings: Superior Evidence</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s authenticity stands out against other religious writings through its superior evidence and divine criteria. Unlike the Book of Mormon, which lacks archaeological support (e.g., no evidence for its cities like Zarahemla), the Bible’s historical accuracy is verified by artifacts like the Tel Dan Stele (circa 840 BCE) mentioning the “House of David.” The Bible’s 66 books show prophetic fulfillment—e.g., Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus, confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder (539 BCE)—while texts like the Quran lack predictive prophecy, relying on later traditions (Hadith) without manuscript support until centuries later.</p><br><p>The Bible’s manuscript evidence, with over 24,000 copies (e.g., Codex Vaticanus, dated 325 CE via paleography), far exceeds the 1,500 for the Iliad or the few dozen for the Vedas. Its internal harmony, despite diverse authors, contrasts with the contradictions in apocryphal works like the Gospel of Thomas, which promotes Gnosticism incompatible with scripture. This distinction, rooted in Jehovah’s guidance, ensures “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8) as the true Word.</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” — Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Historical Spread and Preservation: Enduring Trustworthiness</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is proven by its global spread and meticulous preservation since the first century CE. Early Christians copied and shared the Greek Scriptures, as seen in the Rylands Papyrus P52 (dated 125 CE via paleography) found in Egypt. By the 4th century, codices like Sinaiticus (dated 325–350 CE via paleography) reached the Roman Empire, and the Latin Vulgate spread across Europe by the Middle Ages. Today, the Bible exists in over 3,000 languages, with 240 million New World Translation copies distributed globally, supported by over 24,000 manuscripts, far surpassing other ancient works like the Iliad’s 1,500 copies.</p><br><p>Despite persecution, Jehovah preserved His Word, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) matching modern texts. Artifacts like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE) confirm its historical accuracy, unlike the Book of Mormon’s lack of evidence. This enduring reach and preservation fulfill “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10), proving the Bible’s authenticity as God’s complete Word.</p><br><p><em>“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. — Isaiah 43:10</em></p>

        <p><strong>Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s name stands as the most significant and sacred identifier in all of Scripture, appearing over 7,000 times in the original Hebrew and Greek texts, a frequency that highlights its unparalleled importance to true worship and understanding the Creator. This divine name, represented by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH), translates to “He Causes to Become,” a meaning that encapsulates Jehovah’s role as the purposeful and dynamic Creator who brings His will into reality. The Bible emphatically states, “I am Jehovah; that is my name; I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to carved images” (Isaiah 42:8), making it clear that Jehovah alone is worthy of exclusive devotion and that He refuses to share His unique identity with any false god or idol. This name was first revealed to Moses around 1513 BCE at the burning bush, a dramatic encounter where Jehovah declared, “This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation” (Exodus 3:15). That revelation was not just a label but a promise tied to His eternal purpose—to transform the earth into a paradise populated by perfect humans, as He originally commanded Adam and Eve, saying, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28). Jesus, Jehovah’s obedient Son, reinforced the sanctity of this name by teaching his followers to pray, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified” (Matthew 6:9), and by affirming, “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them” (John 17:26). These statements underscore that knowing and honoring Jehovah’s name is not optional but essential to having a genuine relationship with Him and receiving His blessings.</p><br><p>Despite its importance, Satan, the great enemy of Jehovah, has waged a relentless campaign to erase this name from human awareness, a battle that traces back to Nimrod’s rebellion at Babel around 2269 BCE. At that time, rebellious humans gathered to build a tower and declared, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4), an act of defiance against Jehovah’s authority that sought to elevate human pride over divine rule. This event set the stage for Satan’s ongoing efforts to obscure Jehovah’s identity, a strategy that gained traction centuries later when Jewish scribes, around 300 BCE, began avoiding pronouncing the divine name out of superstition, substituting it with titles like “Adonai” (Lord). This practice carried over into many Bible translations, where “LORD” in all capital letters replaced Jehovah’s name, a move that dilutes His personal identity and fosters confusion about who the true God is. Yet, Jehovah’s mighty acts throughout history shout His name louder than any human effort can silence it. For instance, around 1473 BCE, He parted the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and then drowned Pharaoh’s pursuing army, as “the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen” (Exodus 14:27-28), proving that no power can stand against the One whose name is above all. Similarly, when Jehovah brought down the walls of Jericho around the same period, “the wall fell flat” (Joshua 6:20) at His command, a physical demonstration of His sovereignty that echoes the declaration, “Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God and the King forever” (Jeremiah 10:10). These events serve as undeniable evidence that Jehovah’s name represents His active presence and unmatched power in the universe.</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Suppression</strong></p><br><p>The suppression of Jehovah’s name didn’t stop with ancient superstitions; it intensified as false religion grew in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly by the third century CE, when apostate Christians began adopting pagan practices and titles that further distanced them from the true God. During this period, the influence of Greek philosophy and Roman traditions crept into the emerging church, leading to a deliberate effort to replace Jehovah’s name with generic terms like “God” or “Lord,” a shift that aligned with the blending of Christian teachings with pagan beliefs. However, Jehovah promised that this erasure would not last forever, as He foretold through the prophet Isaiah, “My people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that I am the one speaking—here I am” (Isaiah 52:6). This prophecy is being fulfilled today as the truth about His name is restored, supported by historical evidence such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 but dated to around 200 BCE, which contain numerous instances of the Tetragrammaton in its original Hebrew form. These ancient manuscripts refute claims that Jehovah’s name is irrelevant or outdated, proving that it was cherished and used by His faithful servants long before false traditions took hold. Moreover, archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone, from around 840 BCE, mention “YHWH,” further confirming that Jehovah’s name was known and revered in ancient times, even among neighboring nations. This historical record stands as a testament to Jehovah’s enduring identity and His determination to be known by His people, just as He promised, “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12).</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Fate vs. Free Will</strong></p><br><p>One of Satan’s most insidious lies, propagated through ancient Babylonian astrology around 2000 BCE, is the concept of fate—an unchangeable destiny that strips humans of choice and accountability, locking them into a predetermined path they cannot escape. This belief, which spread through cultures like the Babylonians and later the Greeks, suggested that the stars or gods dictated every event, leaving no room for personal decision or divine mercy. In stark contrast, Jehovah’s Word dismantles this falsehood by affirming the gift of free will, as He told the Israelites, “See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and bad... therefore choose life so that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). This command makes it clear that humans are not puppets controlled by fate but beings created with the ability to choose their course, a freedom that reflects Jehovah’s justice and love. A powerful example of this principle is seen in His dealings with Nineveh around 830 BCE, when He sent Jonah to warn that wicked city of impending destruction, saying, “Only forty days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). Yet, when the Ninevites repented, “God saw their works—that they had turned back from their evil ways—and he felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on them, and he did not bring it” (Jonah 3:10). This dramatic turnaround proves that Jehovah responds to human choices, not a fixed destiny, and that He delights in mercy when people turn to Him, as He says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked one should turn back from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Thus, the lie of fate is exposed as a tool of Satan to rob humans of hope, while Jehovah’s truth offers freedom and life through the exercise of free will in harmony with His will.</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Sovereignty</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s sovereignty is the supreme authority He holds as the Creator and Ruler of the universe, a right He alone possesses, as the Bible declares, “Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything” (Psalm 103:19). This sovereignty was challenged in Eden around 4026 BCE, when Satan deceived Eve, implying Jehovah’s rule was restrictive, saying, “Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” (Genesis 3:1). This rebellion escalated at Babel around 2269 BCE, where humans sought to defy Jehovah’s authority, declaring, “Let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4). Jehovah’s response was swift—He confused their languages and scattered them, proving “there is no one like me” (Isaiah 46:9). Throughout history, He has vindicated His sovereignty through mighty acts, such as delivering Israel from Egypt around 1513 BCE, when He declared, “I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah” (Exodus 12:12). His parting of the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), demonstrated that no power can usurp His rule. Jesus upheld this sovereignty, teaching, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service” (Matthew 4:10), a principle that guides true worshipers to honor Jehovah’s rightful place as King.</p><br><p>Satan’s challenge continues today, as human governments and false religions defy Jehovah’s authority, but His Word assures their end, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). The prophecy of Daniel’s statue, struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44), foretells the collapse of all human rule, a process that began in 1914 when Christ was enthroned. Jehovah’s sovereignty is not just power but justice and love, as He promises, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring a paradise earth where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Vindication Through History</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah has consistently vindicated His sovereignty against challengers. Around 1473 BCE, He crushed Korah’s rebellion against Moses’ authority, when “the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up” (Numbers 16:32), proving His appointed leadership is inviolable. In 539 BCE, He toppled Babylon, as “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), fulfilling His word through Isaiah, who named Cyrus 200 years earlier (Isaiah 44:28). These acts show Jehovah’s control over history, as “he changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings” (Daniel 2:21). Archaeological evidence, like the Cyrus Cylinder from 539 BCE, confirms His precise fulfillment, reinforcing that “Jehovah of armies has sworn: ‘As I have thought, so it will happen’” (Isaiah 14:24).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Triumph</strong></p><br><p>At Armageddon, Jehovah’s sovereignty will be fully vindicated, as “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15), destroying all who oppose Him, for “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). This final act will usher in a world where “every knee will bend to me” (Isaiah 45:23), and His name will be universally known, fulfilling “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers align with this now, proclaiming His rule, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Attributes</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s attributes—love, justice, wisdom, and power—define His character and set Him apart as the only true God, as the Bible states, “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth” (Exodus 34:6). His love is evident in creating humans for life, saying, “Be fruitful and become many” (Genesis 1:28), and providing the ransom through Jesus, “for God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). His justice shines in His impartiality, “there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, nor partiality” (2 Chronicles 19:7), seen when He judged Israel’s idolatry, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (Numbers 25:3). His wisdom crafted the universe, “how many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24), from DNA’s complexity to earth’s ecosystems. His power, “everlasting strength” (Isaiah 26:4), parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21) and will resurrect billions, as “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28-29). These attributes demand worship, as “you must love Jehovah your God with all your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:5).</p><br><p>Satan distorts these attributes, painting Jehovah as cruel or weak, but His actions refute this. When He spared Nineveh after their repentance, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), His mercy shone. His destruction of Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), upheld justice. True worshipers reflect His qualities, “be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Ephesians 5:1), living by His standards.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Balancing Attributes</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah perfectly balances His attributes, never compromising one for another. His love does not excuse sin, as “he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), shown when He struck Uzziah with leprosy for pride (2 Chronicles 26:19). His justice offers mercy, “return to me, and I will return to you” (Zechariah 1:3), as when He forgave David’s repentance, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13). His wisdom ensures His purpose, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11), and His power guarantees it, “nothing is too extraordinary for Jehovah” (Genesis 18:14).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Reflection</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His servants to mirror His attributes, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). Love drives preaching, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39); justice guides fairness, “do not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19); wisdom shapes decisions, “the wisdom from above is first of all pure” (James 3:17); and power comes from His spirit, “you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you” (Acts 1:8). By imitating Jehovah, “we might become imitators of him” (1 Corinthians 11:1), true worshipers honor His name.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Purpose</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s purpose is to restore the earth to a paradise where righteous humans live forever, fulfilling His original intent in Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). He tasked Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28), a plan disrupted by sin but not abandoned, as “my purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10). Through Jesus’ ransom, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28), Jehovah ensures “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). His Kingdom, established in 1914, will “crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), transforming earth into a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). This purpose drives history, from the Flood, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), to Israel’s deliverance, “I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 6:7), proving His unwavering commitment. True worshipers align with this, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>Satan opposes this purpose, promoting rebellion and lies, but Jehovah’s victories—Babylon’s fall in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28)—show his defeat is certain, “the Devil was hurled into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:10). The earth’s design, with its perfect ecosystems, confirms Jehovah’s intent, “he did not create it simply for nothing” (Isaiah 45:18).</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Steps to Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s purpose unfolds through His covenants: the Abrahamic, “all the families of the ground will be blessed by means of you” (Genesis 12:3); the Mosaic, “you will be my special possession” (Exodus 19:5); and the new covenant, “by virtue of my blood” (Luke 22:20). Each step advances His plan, culminating in Christ’s rule, “he must rule as king” (1 Corinthians 15:25). The resurrection, “both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Acts 24:15), ensures all can benefit, as “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Role</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah invites humans to share in His purpose, “seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), by obeying His laws, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2), and preaching His Kingdom, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). When Israel obeyed, “Jehovah blessed them” (Deuteronomy 28:2); when they rebelled, “I disciplined them” (Hosea 10:10). Today, true worshipers fulfill this role, “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), ensuring His purpose triumphs.</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Worship</strong></p><br><p>Worshiping Jehovah is the highest calling, requiring exclusive devotion, as He commands, “You must not have any other gods besides me” (Exodus 20:3). Jesus clarified, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), a lifestyle of obedience, not ritual, as “the one doing the will of my Father” enters the Kingdom (Matthew 7:21). This worship began in Eden, where Adam was to “cultivate and take care of it” (Genesis 2:15), and continued through faithful ones like Abel, whose offering “Jehovah looked with favor” (Genesis 4:4). Jehovah demands purity, striking Nadab and Abihu for “unauthorized fire” (Leviticus 10:1-2), and unity, “one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). His worshipers preach globally, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), a work unbroken since Jesus’ day, “teaching and proclaiming the good news” (Luke 8:1). Satan’s false religions, “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), cannot rival this, as Jehovah’s people are “no part of the world” (John 17:16).</p><br><p>Persecution tests this worship, as when Nero burned Christians in 64 CE, yet “they rejoiced because they had been counted worthy” (Acts 5:41). Daniel faced lions for praying, “he kept praying just as he had been doing” (Daniel 6:10), and Jehovah saved him, “no injury was found on him” (Daniel 6:23). True worshipers today stand firm, “endure to the end” (Matthew 24:13), knowing “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Elements of Worship</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s worship includes prayer, “call upon me in the day of distress” (Psalm 50:15); study, “this book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8); and preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Meetings unite His people, “not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), as in the first century, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Each act honors Jehovah, “offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Opposition Overcome</strong></p><br><p>Satan opposes Jehovah’s worship, “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah protects His servants, as when He freed Peter from prison, “the angel struck Peter on the side” (Acts 12:7). History shows His deliverance—Israel’s exodus, “Jehovah brought them out” (Exodus 12:51)—and prophecy assures victory, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). True worshipers persist, “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Justice</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s justice is perfect, reflecting His nature as “a God of faithfulness, without injustice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). He judges impartially, “Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), yet offers mercy, “he does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9). His justice was evident in the Flood around 2370 BCE, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), for “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). He destroyed Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), for “their sin has become very grave” (Genesis 18:20). Yet, He spared Rahab for her faith, “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), showing “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6). His law to Israel, “you must not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19), set a standard, and His discipline, “I disciplined them to the proper degree” (Jeremiah 30:11), corrects lovingly. True worshipers trust His justice, “Jehovah is a God of justice” (Isaiah 30:18).</p><br><p>Satan’s world mocks justice, but Jehovah’s judgments prevail, as when He struck 185,000 Assyrians, “they were all dead bodies” (2 Kings 19:35), defending His people. At Armageddon, “the great day of Jehovah” (Zephaniah 1:14), His justice will end wickedness, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), fulfilling His promise, “righteousness will dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Mercy in Judgment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s justice includes mercy, “slow to anger and abundant in loyal love” (Exodus 34:6). He forgave Nineveh, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and David, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13), when they repented. His ransom through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice” (1 John 2:2), extends mercy, “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). Yet, mercy has limits, “he will not always shield the guilty” (Exodus 34:7), as Ananias learned, “you have lied to God” (Acts 5:4-5).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Application Today</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His people to reflect His justice, “do not pervert justice or show partiality” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and to love mercy, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). When Israel failed, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (2 Kings 17:18); today, true worshipers uphold fairness, “the one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), preparing for “a new earth” where “justice is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s mercy is His compassionate willingness to forgive and restore, as He declares, “I am compassionate” (Exodus 22:27), and “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). His mercy shone when He spared Israel despite their rebellion, “for the sake of my name I will hold back my anger” (Isaiah 48:9), and when He sent Jesus, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). Around 1513 BCE, after the golden calf, “Jehovah forgave the people” (Exodus 34:9-10), showing His “abundant loyal love” (Psalm 86:5). He saved Rahab, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), and Manasseh, “he humbled himself greatly” (2 Chronicles 33:12-13), proving “his mercy endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). True worshipers seek this mercy, “return to Jehovah your God” (Hosea 14:1), and share it, “become merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:36).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies paint Jehovah as merciless, but His actions refute this—Nineveh’s reprieve, “he felt regret over the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and the resurrection hope, “all those in the memorial tombs” (John 5:28-29), show His heart. False religion’s hellfire doctrine denies this, but Jehovah’s mercy ensures “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Conditions for Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s mercy requires repentance, “let the wicked leave his way” (Isaiah 55:7), as seen when He spared David, “I have sinned greatly” (2 Samuel 12:13). Unrepentant ones, like Achan, faced death, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Joshua 7:1). His mercy extends through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), but demands faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Extending Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah commands His people to show mercy, “you must love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), as the Samaritan did, “he showed mercy to him” (Luke 10:37). Forgiving others, “forgive men their trespasses” (Matthew 6:14), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), reflect His mercy, preparing for a world where “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Promises</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s promises are unbreakable, as “not one word of all his good promise failed” (1 Kings 8:56). He vowed a paradise earth, “the righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), a hope from Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). His covenant with Abraham, “all the families of the ground will be blessed” (Genesis 12:3), was fulfilled through Jesus, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). He promised Israel deliverance, “I will take you as my people” (Exodus 6:7), realized at the Red Sea, “Jehovah saved Israel” (Exodus 14:30). His prophecy of Cyrus, “he is my shepherd” (Isaiah 44:28), freed Israel in 537 BCE, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). Today, His Kingdom promise, “it will crush all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), advances since 1914, urging true worshipers to trust, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p><br><p>Satan challenges these promises, but Jehovah’s record stands—Tyre’s ruin, “a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), and Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), prove His word. False religion denies His promises, but “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s promises shaped history: Noah’s ark, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), saved eight; Joshua’s conquest, “not one word failed” (Joshua 21:45), gave Israel Canaan; and Jerusalem’s fall, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted 70 years. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, confirm His preserved Word, “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Assurance</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s future promises include Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), and resurrection, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). His Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4). True worshipers act now, “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), confident in “Jehovah of armies” (Isaiah 44:6).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>

        <p><strong>Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is the divine government that will soon end all human rule and restore the earth to its intended paradise, a promise fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who began ruling as King in 1914, as foretold, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom’s establishment was marked by “the appointed times of the nations” ending (Luke 21:24), calculated from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE through Daniel’s “seven times” (Daniel 4:25)—2,520 years that pinpoint 1914, when wars, famines, and earthquakes surged, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation... there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7-8). Jehovah’s purpose is unshakable, as He declares, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring that this Kingdom will “fill the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35). It comprises 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:1, 3), while a “great crowd” survives Armageddon to inhabit the earth (Revelation 7:9), a dual hope that reflects Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p><br><p>Human governments, from Rome’s collapse in 476 CE to today’s nations, have failed to bring peace, but Jehovah’s Kingdom succeeds where they falter, as “your throne, O God, is forever and ever” (Psalm 45:6). Its signs since 1914—global conflicts like World War I, pandemics like the Spanish Flu—confirm its presence, and Jesus’ parable of the wheat and weeds shows it grows amid opposition until “the harvest,” when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:39-43). Jehovah’s past interventions, like toppling Babylon in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), preview this Kingdom’s triumph, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). True worshipers pray for its full realization, knowing “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Armageddon</strong></p><br><p>Armageddon is Jehovah’s final war against wickedness, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), a climactic event that follows “the great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning” (Matthew 24:21). It will destroy false religion—“Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2)—and evil governments, as “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). Jehovah’s power was shown when He drowned Egypt’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), and Armageddon will be even greater, for “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). Survivors will inherit a cleansed earth, where “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>1914</strong></p><br><p>The year 1914 marks a pivotal moment in Bible prophecy, when Jesus Christ was enthroned as King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, ending “the appointed times of the nations” (Luke 21:24), a period of Gentile domination that began with Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon in 607 BCE. This date is calculated from Daniel’s prophecy of “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), where Nebuchadnezzar’s seven-year madness symbolized 2,520 years (using “a day for a year” from Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6), stretching from 607 BCE to October 1914. That year saw the outbreak of World War I, an unprecedented conflict that killed millions, alongside famines and the 1918 Spanish Flu, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7). Jehovah’s purpose advanced, as “the Son of man came on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:30), not visibly but in authority, a reign confirmed by “your throne is established from long ago” (Psalm 93:2).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The King Jesus Christ</strong></p><br><p>Jesus Christ is the appointed King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, enthroned in 1914 to fulfill the prophecy, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). As “the faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14) and “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15), Jesus was chosen by Jehovah to rule, declared at his baptism, “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved” (Matthew 3:17). His earthly life, preaching “the good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 4:23), and his sacrificial death, “he bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24), qualified him to reign, as Jehovah exalted him, “God kindly gave him the name that is above every other name” (Philippians 2:9). Since 1914, Jesus rules from heaven, “he must rule as king until he has put all enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25), preparing for Armageddon, where “he treads the winepress of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). True worshipers honor him as King, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and proclaiming his rule, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>Satan opposes Jesus’ kingship, tempting him to worship him, “All these things I will give you” (Matthew 4:9), but Jesus remained loyal, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship” (Matthew 4:10). False religion denies his role, but Jehovah’s Word confirms, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). Jesus’ miracles, like raising Lazarus, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), and his resurrection, “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20), prove his authority as King, fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for a paradise earth.</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Qualifications for Kingship</strong></p><br><p>Jesus earned his kingship through obedience and sacrifice. He resisted Satan’s temptations, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23), and fulfilled prophecy, “he was numbered with the transgressors” (Isaiah 53:12). His ransom, “the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom” (Matthew 20:28), opened the way for salvation, “through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). Jehovah rewarded his faithfulness, “all authority has been given me in heaven and on earth” (Matthew 28:18), making him the only mediator, “one mediator between God and men” (1 Timothy 2:5).</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Reign</strong></p><br><p>Jesus’ reign will fully manifest after Armageddon, when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:43). He will judge the living and the dead, “he will separate people one from another” (Matthew 25:32), and restore earth, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). His rule ensures “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5). True worshipers submit to him now, “every knee should bend” (Philippians 2:10), preparing for his eternal reign.</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The 144,000 Co-Rulers</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom includes 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, chosen from humanity to serve as “a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). These “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3) are sealed from “every tribe of the sons of Israel” (Revelation 7:4), a symbolic number representing faithful ones from the first century to the last days. They partake of the Memorial emblems, as Jesus said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), signifying their heavenly calling, “they will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). Their selection began with the apostles, “I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19), and continues with anointed ones who endure, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Jehovah’s justice ensures their number is complete, “the full number of those who are sealed” (Revelation 7:4), to rule with Christ over a paradise earth.</p><br><p>Satan attacks these anointed, “the dragon became enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah protects them, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). False religion claims all go to heaven, but Scripture limits this hope to the 144,000, while the “great crowd” inherits earth (Revelation 7:9). Their role was foreshadowed when Israel’s priests served, “you will become to me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6), but only the anointed fulfill this in heaven, “they will see his face” (Revelation 22:4).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Selection Process</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah chooses the 144,000 based on faith and loyalty, as seen in the apostles, “you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones” (Matthew 19:28). They face trials, “counted worthy to be dishonored for the sake of that name” (Acts 5:41), and remain “no part of the world” (John 17:16). Their anointing by holy spirit, “the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit” (Romans 8:16), confirms their calling, a process ongoing since Pentecost 33 CE, when “3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Role in the Kingdom</strong></p><br><p>The 144,000 will administer Jehovah’s Kingdom, judging with Christ, “they will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), and aiding the “great crowd,” “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). Their heavenly resurrection, “they were raised in the clouds” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), equips them to serve, “they will rule as kings forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). True worshipers respect their role, supporting the preaching work, “make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), which prepares earth for their rule.</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Crowd</strong></p><br><p>The “great crowd” is a vast multitude from “all nations and tribes and peoples” (Revelation 7:9) who survive Armageddon to live on a paradise earth, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). Unlike the 144,000, they have an earthly hope, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and stand “before the throne” by serving Jehovah faithfully, “rendering him sacred service day and night” (Revelation 7:15). They emerge from “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14), cleansed by Jesus’ blood, “they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation 7:14). Their faith mirrors Noah’s, who “constructed an ark” (Hebrews 11:7), and Rahab’s, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), earning Jehovah’s protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9). True worshipers join this group by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and obeying, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3).</p><br><p>Satan seeks to destroy the great crowd, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah shields them, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). False religion’s heaven-for-all doctrine obscures their hope, but Scripture clarifies, “The earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). Their future is secure, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), as Jehovah’s Kingdom fulfills His purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Requirements for Survival</strong></p><br><p>The great crowd must exercise faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obey, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). They reject false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and remain neutral, “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). Their preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), proves their loyalty, as seen in the first century, “they were all scattered, preaching the word” (Acts 8:4).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Life in Paradise</strong></p><br><p>After Armageddon, the great crowd will “build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), enjoying “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). They will learn from the 144,000, “they will be priests of God” (Revelation 20:6), and welcome the resurrected, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). Their eternal life fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a hope true worshipers cherish now.</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Last Days</strong></p><br><p>The “last days” began in 1914, when Jesus was enthroned, marking “critical times hard to deal with” (2 Timothy 3:1), as prophesied, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7). World War I, the 1918 Spanish Flu, and moral decay—“lovers of themselves” (2 Timothy 3:2)—confirm this period, mirroring Noah’s day, “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). Satan’s expulsion from heaven, “the dragon was hurled down to the earth” (Revelation 12:9), intensified woes, “woe to the earth” (Revelation 12:12). Jehovah’s Kingdom advances through preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14), a sign of “the end” (Matthew 24:14). True worshipers heed the warning, “The great day of Jehovah is near” (Zephaniah 1:14), seeking “Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6).</p><br><p>Satan blinds humanity to these signs, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s prophecies are clear. The increase in wars, famines, and “earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7) since 1914, alongside global preaching, prove “all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress” (Matthew 24:8). False religion ignores this, but Jehovah’s servants proclaim, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19).</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Signs of the Times</strong></p><br><p>Jesus outlined last-days signs: wars, “you will hear of wars and reports of wars” (Matthew 24:6); famines, “there will be food shortages” (Matthew 24:7); and moral decline, “the love of the greater number will grow cold” (Matthew 24:12). History confirms this—World War II, the Great Depression’s hunger, and rising crime since 1914 align with “critical times” (2 Timothy 3:1). The preaching work, reaching billions, fulfills “a witness to all the nations” (Matthew 24:14), a unique sign of Jehovah’s purpose.</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Preparation for the End</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His servants to prepare, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3), by studying, “this book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). The first century saw similar urgency, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Today, true worshipers remain vigilant, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42), trusting “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9).</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Prophetic Evidence</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s prophecies prove His Kingdom’s reality, as “not one of all the good promises Jehovah made to the house of Israel failed” (Joshua 21:45). Daniel’s vision of a statue—gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay (Daniel 2:31-44)—traced world powers from Babylon to Rome, ending with a divided modern era struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom in 1914, “it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Ezekiel’s prophecy, “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it... until he comes whose right it is” (Ezekiel 21:27), pointed to Christ’s enthronement, confirmed by 1914’s war, which shattered empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary. Isaiah named Cyrus 200 years before his birth, “saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd’” (Isaiah 44:28), fulfilled in 539 BCE when he freed Israel, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). These proofs silence doubters, urging true worshipers to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), as “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p>Satan obscures these prophecies, “blinding the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails. Tyre’s ruin, “I will make you a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), fulfilled by Alexander in 332 BCE, and Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation, “until the land had paid off its sabbaths” (2 Chronicles 36:21), show His precision. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, preserve these prophecies, refuting claims of alteration. True worshipers proclaim this evidence, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Confirmations</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s prophecies align with history: Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), remains desolate; the Cyrus Cylinder, from 539 BCE, confirms Israel’s release; and Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted exactly 70 years. The 1914 prophecy, “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), saw World War I erupt, fulfilling “nation will rise against nation” (Matthew 24:7). These events prove “Jehovah is God; there is no other” (Deuteronomy 4:35).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Prophecies yet to be fulfilled include Armageddon, “the battle of the great day” (Revelation 16:14), and the resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29). The Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers trust this, “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35), and prepare by preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Tribulation</strong></p><br><p>The great tribulation is an unprecedented period of distress preceding Armageddon, “such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now” (Matthew 24:21), when Jehovah’s Kingdom will destroy false religion and human governments. It begins with the fall of “Babylon the Great,” false religion, “in one day her plagues will come” (Revelation 18:8), as “the kings of the earth” turn against her (Revelation 17:16). This triggers global chaos, “nations were in anguish” (Luke 21:25), but Jehovah protects His servants, “seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be that you will be concealed” (Zephaniah 2:3). The tribulation culminates in Armageddon, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), where “the kings of the earth and their armies” are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). True worshipers prepare by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and remaining faithful, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p><br><p>Satan fuels this tribulation, “woe to the earth, because the devil has come down to you” (Revelation 12:12), inciting rebellion against Jehovah’s people, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17). False religion’s collapse exposes its lies, “she has become a dwelling place of demons” (Revelation 18:2), but Jehovah’s Kingdom stands firm, “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Stages of the Tribulation</strong></p><br><p>The tribulation unfolds in phases: first, false religion’s destruction, “Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2); then, global distress, “men become faint out of fear” (Luke 21:26); and finally, Armageddon, “he treads the winepress of the wrath” (Revelation 19:15). Jehovah’s past acts, like drowning Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), foreshadow this sequence. His servants are spared, as Noah was, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), ensuring “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Survival Through Faith</strong></p><br><p>Surviving the tribulation requires faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obedience, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42). The great crowd endures, “they have washed their robes” (Revelation 7:14), by rejecting false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Jehovah promises protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9), leading to “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Paradise Restored</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will restore earth to a paradise, fulfilling His original purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18), where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). After Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), the great crowd and resurrected ones will inhabit a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), and “the wolf will reside with the lamb” (Isaiah 11:6). Jesus’ ransom, “you were bought with a price” (1 Peter 1:18-19), reverses Adam’s curse, “cursed is the ground” (Genesis 3:17), restoring Eden’s perfection, “he planted a garden in Eden” (Genesis 2:8). True worshipers pray for this, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preach its certainty, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). The earth’s design—its oxygen, soil, and water—confirms it as humanity’s home, “the earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies, like heaven as the only hope, obscure this truth, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5). Past miracles, like Lazarus’ raising, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), preview this restoration. The Kingdom’s rule ensures “they will build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), a tangible future where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Features of Paradise</strong></p><br><p>Paradise will feature peace, “they will not learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4); health, “the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5); and abundance, “the earth will yield its produce” (Psalm 67:6). The resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), reunites families, and the 144,000 guide, “they will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). This fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a world without “death or mourning or pain” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Role</strong></p><br><p>Humans prepare for paradise by faith, “the righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4), and obedience, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2). Preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living morally, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), align with Jehovah’s purpose. Israel’s blessings for obedience, “Jehovah will bless you” (Deuteronomy 28:2), foreshadow the great crowd’s reward, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>

        <p><strong>Moral Purity</strong></p><br><p>Living a morally pure life reflects Jehovah’s holy standards, as He commands, “This is the will of God, that you should be holy, for you should abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Sexual immorality, including fornication, adultery, and homosexuality, defiles the body, which is “a temple of the holy spirit” (1 Corinthians 6:19). Jehovah struck Israel’s immoral men with death, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (Numbers 25:3), around 1473 BCE, showing His hatred for such sins. Pornography, a modern plague, fuels lustful thoughts, but Jesus warned, “Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28). Unclean habits like drug abuse or drunkenness also dishonor Jehovah, as “drunkards will not inherit God’s Kingdom” (1 Corinthians 6:10). True worshipers maintain purity, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and seek Jehovah’s help through prayer, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10), ensuring their lives honor Him and align with His purpose for a paradise earth, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes immorality, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through media and culture, but Jehovah’s standards are absolute, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). False religion often excuses sin, but Jehovah’s Word condemns it, as seen when He destroyed Sodom for “gross sexual immorality” (Jude 7), around 1918 BCE. True worshipers reject these lies, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and guard their hearts, “Above all things, guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). By living purely, they reflect Jehovah’s qualities, “Be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Ephesians 5:1), and prepare for His Kingdom, where “No unclean thing will enter” (Isaiah 52:1).</p><br><p><em>“This is the will of God, that you should be holy, for you should abstain from sexual immorality.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Guarding the Mind</strong></p><br><p>Moral purity begins in the mind, as “Out of the heart come wicked reasonings” (Matthew 15:19). Avoiding pornography and immoral entertainment, “Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous” (Philippians 4:8), protects thoughts. Joseph fled Potiphar’s wife, “How could I commit this great evil and actually sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9), around 1711 BCE, setting an example. Regular study, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8), and prayer, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13), strengthen resolve, ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><em>“This is the will of God, that you should be holy, for you should abstain from sexual immorality.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Practical Steps</strong></p><br><p>True worshipers take action: avoiding tempting situations, “Do not turn aside to the right or to the left” (Proverbs 4:27); seeking help from elders, “The way of the righteous is made straight” (Isaiah 26:7); and relying on Jehovah, “He will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:6). The first century saw Christians flee immorality, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions uphold purity, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“This is the will of God, that you should be holy, for you should abstain from sexual immorality.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Modesty in Dress</strong></p><br><p>Modesty in dress honors Jehovah, reflecting His dignity and holiness, as Scripture instructs, “Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind” (1 Timothy 2:9). Clothing should be respectful, clean, and not draw undue attention, avoiding tight, revealing, or flashy styles that reflect Satan’s world, “Do not let your adornment be external” (1 Peter 3:3). Jehovah judged Israel’s prideful women, “Jehovah will make the heads of the daughters of Zion scabby” (Isaiah 3:17), around 740 BCE, for vain attire, showing His disapproval. Modest dress glorifies Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and protects moral purity, “Guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). True worshipers choose attire suitable for worship and daily life, “Be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15), ensuring their appearance reflects their devotion, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes immodesty, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through fashion that exalts self, but Jehovah’s standards prevail, “Let your light shine before men” (Matthew 5:16). False religion often ignores modesty, but true worshipers reject vanity, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians dressed simply, “With modesty and soundness of mind” (1 Timothy 2:9), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Modesty prepares them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness will dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.” — 1 Timothy 2:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Respecting Worship</strong></p><br><p>Modesty is vital at meetings and preaching, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), where attire should reflect reverence, “Worship Jehovah in holy array” (Psalm 96:9). Neat, clean clothing honors Jehovah, as seen when Israel prepared for worship, “Sanctify yourselves and wash your garments” (Exodus 19:10), around 1513 BCE. Avoiding worldly fads, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), ensures focus on spiritual matters, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33).</p><br><p><em>“Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.” — 1 Timothy 2:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong></p><br><p>Modesty varies by culture, but Jehovah’s principles are universal, “God is not partial” (Acts 10:34). True worshipers adapt to local norms while upholding decency, “Becoming all things to people of all sorts” (1 Corinthians 9:22). They avoid extremes, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), and prioritize heart condition, “Man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees what the heart is” (1 Samuel 16:7). This prepares them for paradise, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.” — 1 Timothy 2:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Wholesome Speech</strong></p><br><p>Wholesome speech reflects Jehovah’s love and truth, as Scripture urges, “Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6). True worshipers use kind, truthful, and upbuilding words, “Let your speech always be with graciousness” (Ephesians 4:29), avoiding gossip, slander, or crude talk, which dishonor Jehovah, “A slanderer will not be established in the earth” (Psalm 140:11). When Miriam gossiped against Moses, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against her” (Numbers 12:9), around 1473 BCE, showing His hatred for harmful speech. Speech should build faith, “Encourage one another” (1 Thessalonians 5:11), and glorify Jehovah, “Offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15). True worshipers guard their tongues, “The one guarding his mouth preserves his life” (Proverbs 13:3), ensuring their words align with Jehovah’s purpose, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes vile speech, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through media and crude humor, but Jehovah’s standards are clear, “Let corrupt communication not come out of your mouth” (Ephesians 4:29). False religion often tolerates gossip, but true worshipers reject it, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians spoke boldly, “Proclaiming the good news” (Acts 8:4), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Wholesome speech prepares them for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p><em>“Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.” — Colossians 4:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Building Others Up</strong></p><br><p>Speech should encourage, “Speak consolingly to the depressed souls” (1 Thessalonians 5:14), as Paul did, “Strengthening the souls of the disciples” (Acts 14:22). Avoiding gossip, “Do not spread a bad report” (Exodus 23:1), and crude humor, “Obscene jesting is not proper” (Ephesians 5:4), reflects love, “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). True worshipers use words to preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), ensuring “The tongue of the wise brings healing” (Proverbs 12:18).</p><br><p><em>“Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.” — Colossians 4:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Controlling the Tongue</strong></p><br><p>Controlling speech requires effort, “The tongue is a fire” (James 3:6). Prayer, “Set a guard, O Jehovah, over my mouth” (Psalm 141:3), and study, “My mouth will speak wisdom” (Psalm 49:3), help. David’s example, “I will guard my mouth” (Psalm 39:1), inspires vigilance. True worshipers avoid harmful words, “Put away all malicious bitterness” (Ephesians 4:31), and speak truth, “Speak truth each one with his neighbor” (Ephesians 4:25), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.” — Colossians 4:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Healthy Associations</strong></p><br><p>Choosing healthy associations strengthens faith, as Scripture warns, “He who walks with wise people will become wise, but he who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly” (Proverbs 13:20). Friends should support spiritual goals, “Bad associations spoil useful habits” (1 Corinthians 15:33), avoiding those who reject Jehovah’s standards, “Do not be misled” (1 Corinthians 15:33). When Israel mingled with pagans, “They adopted their customs” (2 Kings 17:8), around 740 BCE, Jehovah punished them, “I disciplined them” (Hosea 10:10). True worshipers seek companions who love Jehovah, “I am a friend to all who fear you” (Psalm 119:63), and build faith, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:24). This ensures alignment with Jehovah’s purpose, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14), and prepares for paradise, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes harmful associations, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s people remain separate, “No part of the world” (John 17:16). False religion mixes with unbelievers, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians chose faithful friends, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Healthy associations fortify them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“He who walks with wise people will become wise.” — Proverbs 13:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Choosing Faithful Friends</strong></p><br><p>Friends should share Jehovah’s values, “Can two walk together unless they are in agreement?” (Amos 3:3). Meetings provide such companions, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), as seen when Ruth chose Naomi, “Your people will be my people” (Ruth 1:16), around 1100 BCE. Avoiding worldly peers, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), protects faith, “The one walking with the wise will become wise” (Proverbs 13:20).</p><br><p><em>“He who walks with wise people will become wise.” — Proverbs 13:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Positive Influence</strong></p><br><p>Healthy associations uplift, “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another” (Proverbs 27:17). True worshipers encourage preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and endurance, “The one who endures to the end” (Matthew 24:13). Paul’s companions, like Timothy, strengthened him, “A genuine child in the faith” (1 Timothy 1:2). Choosing such friends ensures “The way of the righteous is made straight” (Isaiah 26:7), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“He who walks with wise people will become wise.” — Proverbs 13:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Balanced Recreation</strong></p><br><p>Balanced recreation refreshes true worshipers without compromising Jehovah’s standards, as Scripture urges, “Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things” (Philippians 4:8). Clean fun, like family activities or nature, honors Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), while avoiding worldly excesses, “The world is passing away” (1 John 2:17). Israel’s feasts, like the Festival of Booths, “You must rejoice before Jehovah” (Leviticus 23:40), around 1513 BCE, showed joyful rest. Physical exercise, “Bodily training is beneficial” (1 Timothy 4:8), supports health, but spiritual priorities come first, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33). True worshipers choose recreation that uplifts, “Be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15), preparing for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes immoral entertainment, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), like violent games or impure shows, but Jehovah’s standards reject these, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9). False religion often indulges in excess, but true worshipers avoid it, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians found joy in fellowship, “They continued devoting themselves to breaking bread” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Balanced recreation strengthens them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things.” — Philippians 4:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Choosing Clean Fun</strong></p><br><p>Recreation should align with Jehovah’s principles, “Whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable” (Philippians 4:8). Family outings, music, or sports, if clean, refresh, “A joyful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22). Avoiding immoral media, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), mirrors Daniel’s resolve, “He refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8), around 617 BCE. True worshipers prioritize spiritual activities, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><em>“Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things.” — Philippians 4:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Maintaining Balance</strong></p><br><p>Recreation must not overshadow spiritual goals, “The time left is reduced” (1 Corinthians 7:29). Moderation, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), prevents obsession, as Solomon warned, “I said to myself, ‘Come, test out pleasure’... it was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:1-2). True worshipers balance fun with preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and worship, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things.” — Philippians 4:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Spiritual Routine</strong></p><br><p>A spiritual routine strengthens faith, as Scripture urges, “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads His law in an undertone day and night” (Psalm 1:2). True worshipers maintain personal study, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8); family worship, “Train a boy in the way he should go” (Proverbs 22:6); meeting attendance, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:24-25); and preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). These habits sustained Daniel, who prayed “three times a day” (Daniel 6:10), around 539 BCE, despite threats. They fortify against Satan’s attacks, “Put on the complete suit of armor from God” (Ephesians 6:11), and align with Jehovah’s purpose, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14). True worshipers prioritize these, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s world distracts from spiritual routines, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand diligence, “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching” (1 Timothy 4:16). False religion neglects Bible study, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians met regularly, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). A spiritual routine ensures readiness for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“Not forsaking our meeting together.” — Hebrews 10:24-25</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Building Faith</strong></p><br><p>Personal study deepens knowledge, “My mouth will speak wisdom” (Psalm 49:3), as Timothy studied, “Handling the word of truth aright” (2 Timothy 2:15). Family worship unites, “You and your household will be saved” (Acts 16:31), and meetings encourage, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). Preaching saves, “I am clean from the blood of all men” (Acts 20:26). These habits, like Ezra’s study, “Ezra prepared his heart to consult the Law” (Ezra 7:10), around 455 BCE, build faith, “The righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4).</p><br><p><em>“Not forsaking our meeting together.” — Hebrews 10:24-25</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Overcoming Obstacles</strong></p><br><p>Busyness and opposition challenge routines, but Jehovah provides strength, “He gives power to the tired one” (Isaiah 40:29). Prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and discipline, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), help. True worshipers persist, as Paul did, “We do not give up” (2 Corinthians 4:1), ensuring “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). This prepares them for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Not forsaking our meeting together.” — Hebrews 10:24-25</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Responsible Work Ethic</strong></p><br><p>A responsible work ethic honors Jehovah, as Scripture states, “Every man should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God” (Ecclesiastes 3:13). True worshipers are honest, diligent workers, “Let the thief no longer steal, but let him do hard work” (Ephesians 4:28), avoiding laziness, “The idle one is in want” (Proverbs 19:15). They reject materialism, “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things” (1 Timothy 6:10), trusting Jehovah’s care, “Your Father knows what you need” (Matthew 6:8). Joseph’s diligence, “Jehovah was with him” (Genesis 39:2), around 1711 BCE, brought blessings. Work glorifies Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and supports spiritual goals, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s world promotes greed and dishonesty, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand integrity, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18). False religion often chases wealth, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians worked diligently, “Working with our hands” (1 Corinthians 4:12), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). A responsible work ethic ensures readiness for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“Every man should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.” — Ecclesiastes 3:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Honesty in Work</strong></p><br><p>Honesty reflects Jehovah’s truth, “Let your Yes mean Yes” (Matthew 5:37). True worshipers avoid cheating, “Do not use dishonest standards” (Leviticus 19:35), as Zacchaeus repented, “I will pay back four times over” (Luke 19:8), around 31 CE. Diligence, “Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might” (Ecclesiastes 9:10), honors Jehovah, “Work as to Jehovah and not to men” (Colossians 3:23). This ensures “Jehovah will bless you” (Deuteronomy 28:2).</p><br><p><em>“Every man should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.” — Ecclesiastes 3:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Avoiding Materialism</strong></p><br><p>Materialism distracts, “You cannot slave for God and for Riches” (Matthew 6:24). True worshipers live simply, “Having food and clothing, we will be content” (1 Timothy 6:8), trusting Jehovah, “He will not abandon his loyal ones” (Psalm 37:28). Solomon’s excess, “All of it was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:11), warns against greed. Prioritizing spiritual riches, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), prepares for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Every man should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.” — Ecclesiastes 3:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Personal Cleanliness</strong></p><br><p>Personal cleanliness reflects Jehovah’s holiness, as Scripture urges, “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God” (2 Corinthians 7:1). True worshipers maintain physical hygiene, “Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean” (Isaiah 1:16), and respect health, “Bodily training is beneficial” (1 Timothy 4:8). Israel’s cleansing before worship, “Wash your garments” (Exodus 19:10), around 1513 BCE, set a standard. Cleanliness honors Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and prepares for service, “Sanctify yourselves” (Leviticus 20:7). It reflects inner purity, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), aligning with Jehovah’s purpose, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s world neglects holiness, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand cleanliness, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). False religion ignores hygiene’s spiritual link, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians maintained purity, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Cleanliness prepares for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Health and Hygiene</strong></p><br><p>Cleanliness includes grooming, “Wash yourselves” (Isaiah 1:16), and healthy habits, “A sound mind in a sound body” (3 John 2). Avoiding harmful substances, “Drunkards will not inherit God’s Kingdom” (1 Corinthians 6:10), mirrors Daniel’s choice, “He refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8), around 617 BCE.

        <br><p><strong>Spiritual Cleanliness</strong></p><br><p>Cleanliness reflects holiness, “Cleanse your hands, you sinners” (James 4:8). Study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and prayer, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), purify the heart. True worshipers avoid moral defilement, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and serve cleanly, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). This prepares for paradise, “No unclean thing will enter” (Isaiah 52:1), where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p>

        <p><strong>The Memorial of Christ’s Death</strong></p><br><p>The Memorial of Christ’s death, observed annually on Nisan 14, is the most sacred event for true worshipers, commemorating Jesus’ sacrifice that provides salvation, as he said, “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf” (Luke 22:20). Instituted in 33 CE during the Passover, Jesus replaced the lamb with unleavened bread and wine, symbols of his body and blood, instructing, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). This event fulfills Jehovah’s purpose, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7), offering life to obedient mankind, “The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28). Only the 144,000 anointed partake of the emblems, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), while millions attend to show gratitude, “Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God” (Deuteronomy 16:1). The date, tied to the Jewish lunar calendar, ensures precision, as “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7).</p><br><p>Satan’s false religions distort this event with pagan rituals like Easter, blending Christ’s resurrection with fertility rites traced to Babylon around 2000 BCE, but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The Memorial’s simplicity—bread, wine, prayer—rejects such lies, reflecting Jesus’ humility, “He poured out his life even to death” (Isaiah 53:12). Its annual observance, like the Passover’s deliverance from Egypt in 1513 BCE, “This day will serve as a memorial for you” (Exodus 12:14), underscores Jehovah’s mercy, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). True worshipers prepare diligently, “Let us celebrate the festival, not with old leaven, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring Christ’s sacrifice that upholds Jehovah’s justice and love.</p><br><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — Luke 22:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Passover Connection</strong></p><br><p>The Memorial is rooted in the Passover, established when Jehovah spared Israel’s firstborn in Egypt, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13), a deliverance celebrated annually, “You must keep it as a festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14). Jesus, “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29), fulfilled this type, dying on Nisan 14, 33 CE, as “our Passover lamb” (1 Corinthians 5:7). The bread and wine replace the lamb, signifying his perfect sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14). This connection shows Jehovah’s consistent purpose, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6), linking past deliverance to future salvation, “Through him you believe in God, who raised him up from the dead” (1 Peter 1:21).</p><br><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — Luke 22:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Anointed Participation</strong></p><br><p>Only the 144,000, sealed for heavenly life, partake of the Memorial emblems, as Jesus told his apostles, “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day” (John 6:54). Their partaking signifies their role as co-rulers, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6), confirmed by the spirit, “The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children” (Romans 8:16). Others attend to observe, showing faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and gratitude for the ransom, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). This distinction refutes false teachings that all partake, ensuring “we must all appear before the judgment seat of the Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:10).</p><br><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — Luke 22:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Ransom Sacrifice</strong></p><br><p>The ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of Jehovah’s provision for salvation, as “the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28). By dying on Nisan 14, 33 CE, Jesus offered a perfect human life to balance Adam’s sin, “Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin” (Romans 5:12), fulfilling Jehovah’s justice, “The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4). This sacrifice, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), opens the way for forgiveness and eternal life, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). It benefits both the 144,000, who gain heavenly life, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3), and the great crowd, who inherit earth, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). True worshipers honor this during the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), reflecting gratitude, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies, like salvation through works or pagan rituals, obscure the ransom’s value, but Jehovah’s Word exposes them, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The ransom’s power is seen in past types, like the Passover lamb, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13), and confirmed by Jesus’ resurrection, “The firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20). False religion’s hellfire doctrine denies the ransom’s purpose, but Jehovah’s mercy ensures “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). True worshipers live by its benefits, “Through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19).</p><br><p><em>“The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many.” — Matthew 20:28</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Justice and Mercy</strong></p><br><p>The ransom satisfies Jehovah’s justice, “The wages sin pays is death” (Romans 6:23), by providing a perfect substitute, “He bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24). It also reveals His mercy, “He does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9), offering salvation to all who exercise faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). This balance is seen in Israel’s atonement day, “Make atonement for the house of Israel” (Leviticus 16:34), a type of Christ’s greater sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).</p><br><p><em>“The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many.” — Matthew 20:28</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Application Today</strong></p><br><p>True worshipers apply the ransom by faith, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1), and obedience, “The one doing the will of my Father” (Matthew 7:21). They reject false teachings, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and preach its benefits, “Make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19). The first century saw thousands accept this, “About 3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41), and today, millions prepare for the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), trusting “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p><br><p><em>“The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many.” — Matthew 20:28</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The New Covenant</strong></p><br><p>The new covenant, instituted by Jesus at the Memorial, is Jehovah’s provision for the 144,000 to serve as kings and priests in His Kingdom, as Jesus said, “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood” (Luke 22:20). Foretold by Jeremiah, “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel... I will put my law in their hearts” (Jeremiah 31:31, 33), it replaced the Mosaic Law, “He has made the first obsolete” (Hebrews 8:13), offering forgiveness through Christ’s sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14). The anointed, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3), partake of the Memorial emblems, confirming their role, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). This covenant ensures their heavenly resurrection, “We shall all be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51), to rule with Christ, “They will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). True worshipers honor this covenant by supporting the anointed, “Make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living by its principles, “Love is the law’s fulfillment” (Romans 13:10).</p><br><p>Satan’s false religions misrepresent the new covenant, claiming all are included, but Scripture limits it to the 144,000, “A kingdom and priests to our God” (Revelation 5:10). The Mosaic Law’s sacrifices, “The blood of bulls and goats” (Hebrews 10:4), were types of Christ’s perfect sacrifice, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2). False teachings like universal salvation deny Jehovah’s purpose, but the new covenant’s benefits extend indirectly to the great crowd through the anointed’s rule, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). The first century saw its start, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, true worshipers uphold it, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).</p><br><p><em>“This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood.” — Luke 22:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Role of the Anointed</strong></p><br><p>The 144,000, under the new covenant, are sealed by holy spirit, “The spirit itself bears witness” (Romans 8:16), and prepared through trials, “Counted worthy to be dishonored” (Acts 5:41). Their role as priests benefits humanity, “They will be priests of God” (Revelation 20:6), guiding the great crowd in paradise, “No resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). Their kingship ensures justice, “They will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “My purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10).</p><br><p><em>“This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood.” — Luke 22:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Benefits for Mankind</strong></p><br><p>While only the anointed are in the new covenant, its blessings reach the great crowd, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), through Christ’s ransom, “Everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). The covenant’s law, written on hearts, promotes love, “You must love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). True worshipers support this by preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and living faithfully, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood.” — Luke 22:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Passover Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Jesus’ death on Nisan 14, 33 CE, fulfilled the Passover, established in 1513 BCE when Jehovah spared Israel’s firstborn, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13). As “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29), Jesus replaced the Passover lamb, “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7), his blood providing salvation, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). The Memorial commemorates this fulfillment, with bread and wine symbolizing his body and blood, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). This event ties Jehovah’s past deliverance, “I brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 12:51), to His future purpose, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). True worshipers observe the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring Jehovah’s consistent purpose, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).</p><br><p>Satan’s pagan festivals, like Easter, rooted in Babylonian rites from 2000 BCE, obscure this truth, but Jehovah’s Word refutes them, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The Passover’s annual observance, “A memorial for you throughout your generations” (Exodus 12:14), foreshadowed the Memorial’s simplicity, rejecting false rituals. Jesus’ perfect sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14), surpasses the Passover, offering eternal life, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). True worshipers reject lies, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and prepare diligently, “Observe the month of Abib” (Deuteronomy 16:1).</p><br><p><em>“Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.” — 1 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p><br><p>The Passover marked Israel’s deliverance from Egypt, “Jehovah struck every firstborn” (Exodus 12:29), a type of Christ’s greater deliverance, “He bore our sins” (1 Peter 2:24). The lamb’s blood, “Not a bone of it will you break” (Exodus 12:46), prefigured Jesus, “Not a bone of his will be broken” (John 19:36). Archaeological finds, like Egyptian records of plagues, support the Exodus account, confirming Jehovah’s power, “I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 6:7). The Memorial continues this legacy, “A festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14).</p><br><p><em>“Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.” — 1 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Spiritual Significance</strong></p><br><p>The Passover’s fulfillment in Christ deepens its meaning, “Our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7), offering forgiveness, “Their sins I will remember no more” (Hebrews 8:12). The Memorial calls for reflection, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), and gratitude, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). True worshipers preach this truth, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for paradise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), where “Death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.” — 1 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Anointed’s Role</strong></p><br><p>The 144,000 anointed, chosen to partake in the Memorial, are Jehovah’s “kingdom and priests” (Revelation 5:10), sealed for heavenly life to rule with Christ, “They will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). Their partaking of the bread and wine, “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life” (John 6:54), confirms their calling, “The spirit itself bears witness” (Romans 8:16). Selected since 33 CE, “I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19), they endure trials, “Counted worthy to be dishonored” (Acts 5:41), to serve as co-rulers, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). Their role supports Jehovah’s purpose, “My purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10), guiding the great crowd in paradise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). True worshipers respect their role, supporting the preaching work, “Make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and honoring the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).</p><br><p>Satan attacks the anointed, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah protects them, “No weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). False religion claims all partake, but Scripture restricts this to the 144,000, “Bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3). Their role was foreshadowed by Israel’s priests, “A kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6), but only the anointed fulfill this in heaven, “They will see his face” (Revelation 22:4). The first century saw their selection begin, “About 3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41), and today, true worshipers uphold their work, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Selection and Trials</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah chooses the anointed for their faith, “You who have followed me” (Matthew 19:28), and loyalty, “The one who endures to the end” (Matthew 24:13). They face persecution, as Paul did, “I bear on my body the marks of Jesus” (Galatians 6:17), and remain “no part of the world” (John 17:16). Their anointing, “You have an anointing from the holy one” (1 John 2:20), equips them for service, “They will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), ensuring Jehovah’s justice, “The full number of those who are sealed” (Revelation 7:4).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Responsibilities</strong></p><br><p>In the Kingdom, the anointed will administer justice, “They sat on thrones, and judgment was given to them” (Revelation 20:4), and guide humanity, “They will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). Their heavenly resurrection, “Raised in the clouds” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), prepares them to serve, “They will rule as kings forever” (Revelation 22:5). True worshipers support them now, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14), preparing for paradise, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Crowd’s Hope</strong></p><br><p>The great crowd, attending the Memorial, have an earthly hope, “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29), made possible by Christ’s ransom, “A ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). They survive the great tribulation, “They have washed their robes” (Revelation 7:14), to inhabit paradise, “No resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). Their faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obedience, “Seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3), mirror Noah’s, “He constructed an ark” (Hebrews 11:7). They attend the Memorial to show gratitude, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). True worshipers join this hope, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies, like heaven for all, obscure this hope, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “The earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). False religion’s rituals, like Easter, rooted in Babylon, are rejected, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The great crowd’s hope is foreshadowed by Israel’s deliverance, “Jehovah brought them out” (Exodus 12:51), and confirmed by Jesus’ promise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). True worshipers prepare, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Requirements for Survival</strong></p><br><p>The great crowd must exercise faith, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1), and remain loyal, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). They reject false worship, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21), and stay neutral, “My Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). Their preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), proves devotion, as in the first century, “They were scattered, preaching the word” (Acts 8:4).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Life in Paradise</strong></p><br><p>In paradise, the great crowd will “build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), enjoying peace, “They will not learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4), and health, “The eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5). The resurrection, “Those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), reunites families under the anointed’s guidance, “They will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). True worshipers prepare now, “Seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), for “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Rejection of False Rituals</strong></p><br><p>The Memorial’s simplicity—bread, wine, prayer—rejects false rituals like Easter, rooted in Babylonian fertility rites from 2000 BCE, which blend Christ’s resurrection with paganism, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). Jehovah demands pure worship, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), as seen when He struck Nadab and Abihu for “unauthorized fire” (Leviticus 10:1-2). The Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), honors Christ’s sacrifice, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), without pagan trappings. True worshipers reject false festivals, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and prepare for the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), upholding Jehovah’s standard, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).</p><br><p>Satan promotes false rituals to obscure Christ’s sacrifice, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word exposes them. Easter’s eggs and rabbits, tied to Babylonian goddess Ishtar, contrast with the Memorial’s purity, “Not with old leaven” (1 Corinthians 5:8). Israel’s idolatry, “They worshiped the Baals” (Judges 2:11), brought punishment, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Judges 2:14), a warning for today. True worshipers stand firm, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), honoring the ransom, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Pagan Influence</strong></p><br><p>Pagan rituals infiltrated false religion by the third century CE, blending Christian events with festivals like Saturnalia and Ishtar’s rites, “They adopted the customs of the nations” (2 Kings 17:8). The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE formalized Easter, rejecting the Passover’s timing, but Jehovah’s Word preserves truth, “The word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). Archaeological finds, like Babylonian tablets, confirm these pagan origins, exposing “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5). The Memorial avoids such lies, “A festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pure Worship Today</strong></p><br><p>True worshipers maintain pure worship, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), by observing the Memorial correctly, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), and preaching truth, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). The first century rejected paganism, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions follow, “No part of the world” (John 17:16). This ensures Jehovah’s blessing, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), and a future where “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Gratitude for the Ransom</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude for Christ’s ransom, “The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28), motivates true worshipers to attend the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), and live faithfully, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). The ransom, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), frees humanity from sin’s penalty, “The wages sin pays is death” (Romans 6:23), offering eternal life, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). This reflects Jehovah’s love, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16), and justice, “The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4). True worshipers express gratitude by preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and obeying, “The one doing the will of my Father” (Matthew 7:21), preparing for paradise, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies, like salvation through works, diminish the ransom’s value, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1). False religion’s rituals obscure gratitude, but the Memorial’s focus on Christ’s sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14), inspires devotion. The first century saw thousands respond, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions attend, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring “Through him you believe in God” (1 Peter 1:21).</p><br><p><em>“You were bought with a price.” — 1 Corinthians 6:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Expressing Gratitude</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude is shown through worship, “Offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15), and moral living, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). Preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), spreads the ransom’s benefits, as Paul did, “I am clean from the blood of all men” (Acts 20:26). The Memorial calls for reflection, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), ensuring sincerity, “Not with old leaven” (1 Corinthians 5:8). This mirrors Israel’s gratitude for deliverance, “A memorial for you” (Exodus 12:14).</p><br><p><em>“You were bought with a price.” — 1 Corinthians 6:20</em></p>

        <p>The Bible teaches true Christians to remain neutral, following Jesus’ example by abstaining from worldly conflicts and politics, focusing solely on God’s Kingdom.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Old Testament Examples of Neutrality: Early Loyalty to God</strong></p><br><p>The principle of neutrality was evident in the Hebrew Scriptures, where God’s servants prioritized His sovereignty over worldly alliances. Around 1513 BCE, when Israel received the Law, God commanded, “You must not form any marriage alliance with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3), prohibiting political or military ties with pagan nations. Prophets like Daniel, in the 6th century BCE, exemplified this by refusing to bow to King Darius’ image (Daniel 6:10), choosing loyalty to God over Babylonian politics.</p><br><p>Unlike surrounding nations, such as Assyria, which formed military coalitions (e.g., the Assyrian Chronicles, circa 700 BCE), Israel was to rely on God, as seen in Isaiah 31:1: “Woe to those going down to Egypt for assistance.” The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) preserve these teachings, showing God’s expectation of neutrality, fulfilling “You must not walk in the statutes of the nations” (Leviticus 20:23).</p><br><p><em>“You must not walk in the statutes of the nations.” — Leviticus 20:23</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jesus’ Example of Neutrality: No Part of the World</strong></p><br><p>Jesus set the ultimate example of neutrality during His ministry from 29 to 33 CE, refusing to engage in worldly politics or conflicts. In John 18:36, when arrested, He declared, “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought.” Jesus also avoided political disputes, as seen in Luke 20:25 when He said, “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God,” sidestepping a trap about Roman taxes.</p><br><p>Unlike the Zealots, who sought to overthrow Roman rule through violence, Jesus focused on preaching God’s Kingdom (Matthew 4:17), even healing a Roman centurion’s servant (Matthew 8:5-13) without taking sides. Early manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve these accounts, affirming Jesus’ neutrality, fulfilling “I am no part of the world” (John 17:16).</p><br><p><em>“I am no part of the world.” — John 17:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Christians and Neutrality: Following Jesus’ Lead</strong></p><br><p>Early Christians, from 33 to 100 CE, followed Jesus’ example by remaining neutral in political and military affairs. Acts 5:29 records Peter and the apostles saying, “We must obey God as ruler rather than men,” when ordered to stop preaching. Christians refused to join Roman military campaigns, as noted by historian Tertullian (circa 200 CE), who wrote that Christians “do not go forth as soldiers.” They also avoided emperor worship, often facing persecution, as seen in Revelation 2:10: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer.”</p><br><p>Unlike Roman citizens who participated in political festivals (e.g., Saturnalia), Christians focused on God’s Kingdom, as Paul wrote in Philippians 3:20: “Our citizenship exists in the heavens.” Early manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE) preserve these teachings, showing neutrality as a Christian hallmark, fulfilling “We must obey God as ruler rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p><br><p><em>“We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” — Acts 5:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Neutrality in Political Affairs: Not Voting or Governing</strong></p><br><p>The Bible instructs Christians to remain neutral in political affairs, including abstaining from voting or seeking governmental roles, as Jesus taught in John 17:16: “They are no part of the world.” Paul reinforced this in 2 Timothy 2:4, comparing Christians to soldiers who “do not get involved in the commercial affairs of life,” meaning worldly politics. Early Christians, as noted by historian Eusebius (circa 300 CE), avoided Roman political offices, focusing on God’s Kingdom.</p><br><p>Unlike many religious groups that endorse candidates or participate in elections, true Christians prioritize allegiance to God’s Kingdom over human governments. For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians did not engage in political campaigns, focusing instead on preaching (Acts 1:8). This neutrality ensures Christians remain “ambassadors substituting for Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:20), free from political bias.</p><br><p><em>“We are ambassadors substituting for Christ.” — 2 Corinthians 5:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Neutrality in War and Conflict: Refusing to Fight</strong></p><br><p>Neutrality extends to refusing participation in war, as Jesus commanded in Matthew 26:52: “All those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.” Early Christians, as recorded by historian Justin Martyr (circa 150 CE), “refused to make war upon their enemies,” choosing peace over violence. Isaiah 2:4’s prophecy, “They will beat their swords into plowshares,” reflects God’s will for His people to avoid bloodshed, a principle preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE).</p><br><p>Unlike nations that waged religious wars, such as the Crusades (1095–1291), true Christians have historically avoided military conflict, even under pressure. For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians faced execution for refusing to serve in the army, prioritizing God’s law of peace, fulfilling “Love your enemies” (Matthew 5:44).</p><br><p><em>“Love your enemies.” — Matthew 5:44</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Neutrality in Social Issues: Avoiding Partisanship</strong></p><br><p>Neutrality also means avoiding partisan stances on social issues, as Christians focus on God’s standards. James 4:4 warns, “Friendship with the world is enmity with God,” urging Christians to avoid divisive movements. Early Christians did not join Roman social reforms, as noted by historian Origen (circa 250 CE), who said Christians “do not take part in public affairs.” Instead, they preached God’s Kingdom as the solution (Acts 1:8).</p><br><p>In modern times, true Christians remain neutral in debates like civil rights protests or economic policies, focusing on Bible-based solutions. For instance, during the 20th century, Christians avoided taking sides in labor movements, promoting unity through God’s Word instead. This approach ensures Christians remain “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14), offering hope beyond human solutions.</p><br><p><em>“You are the light of the world.” — Matthew 5:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Benefits of Neutrality: Unity and Peace</strong></p><br><p>Neutrality fosters unity and peace among God’s people, as seen throughout history. By not taking sides in wars or politics, early Christians maintained unity across diverse regions, as foretold in Micah 4:3: “They will not lift up sword, nation against nation.” For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians from different backgrounds worshiped together, focusing on God’s Kingdom (Acts 2:44).</p><br><p>Unlike divided religious groups, such as during the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865) where churches split over slavery, neutrality ensures Christians remain united. In modern conflicts, such as the Balkan Wars (1990s), true Christians avoided ethnic divisions, focusing on spiritual brotherhood. This unity, rooted in God’s standards, fulfills “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations” (1 Peter 2:12).</p><br><p><em>“Maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” — 1 Peter 2:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Neutrality in God’s Kingdom: A Future Without Division</strong></p><br><p>In God’s Kingdom, neutrality will be fully realized as all human divisions—political, military, and social—disappear. Daniel 2:44 prophesies, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed,” crushing all human governments. Revelation 21:4 promises a future where “death will be no more,” with no need for worldly allegiance, as “the Lord will be King over all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9).</p><br><p>Unlike today’s world, where conflicts like the Ukraine-Russia war (2022–present) divide nations, God’s Kingdom will unite all under divine rule, fulfilling the prayer “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10). Christians’ neutrality now prepares them for this future, ensuring they “inherit the Kingdom prepared for you” (Matthew 25:34).</p><br><p><em>“Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.” — Matthew 25:34</em></p>

        <p><strong>Judaism: Rejection of Jehovah’s Messiah</strong></p><br><p>Judaism honors Jehovah but denies Jesus as Messiah, missing Isaiah 53’s suffering servant from the Dead Sea Scrolls (150 BCE), fulfilled in Christ (John 14:6), adding Talmud traditions like Hanukkah (200-500 CE) not in Scripture. Masada’s synagogues (70 CE) show Law devotion, not Jehovah’s full plan. The Talmud, compiled between 200–500 CE, prohibits pronouncing Jehovah’s name, contradicting Psalm 83:18’s call to know Him, leading Jews away from His direct worship. Rabbinic mysticism, like the Kabbalah (12th century CE, Spain), introduces esoteric Sefirot teachings, mirroring pagan mysticism with no Scriptural basis, obscuring Jehovah’s truth. Judaism also ignores Daniel 9:24-26’s prophecy of the Messiah’s arrival 483 years after Jerusalem’s rebuilding decree (455 BCE to 29 CE), which Jesus fulfilled, showing blindness to Jehovah’s plan. Post-temple destruction (70 CE), Judaism shifted to prayer and study for atonement, ignoring Hebrews 10:4’s truth that animal sacrifices cannot remove sins, missing Jesus’ ransom (1 Timothy 2:6). The Oral Torah, written in the Mishnah (200 CE), claims divine origin, yet Deuteronomy 4:2 forbids adding to Jehovah’s commands, showing human tradition over divine truth. Modern Passover (post-70 CE) omits the lamb, central to Exodus 12:5-6, symbolizing Christ (1 Corinthians 5:7), rendering it incomplete and rejecting Jehovah’s provision. Judaism’s reliance on myths and traditions keeps followers far from Jehovah’s light.</p><br><p><em>“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” —John 14:6</em></p><br><p><em>“That men may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” —Psalm 83:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Seventy weeks are decreed on your people to anoint the Holy of Holies.” —Daniel 9:24</em></p><br><p><em>“It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.” —Hebrews 10:4</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not add to the word that I am commanding you.” —Deuteronomy 4:2</em></p><br><p><em>“Christ became our Passover lamb.” —1 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Buddhism: A Godless Mythical Path</strong></p><br><p>Buddhism seeks nirvana, ignoring Jehovah as Creator (Revelation 4:11), with Siddhartha’s 500 BCE teachings unproven—relics like Buddha’s tooth lack evidence, and science (EEGs) refutes reincarnation. It’s a godless path, missing Jehovah’s truth. Stories of Siddhartha’s birth, like emerging from his mother’s side under a tree (Jataka tales, 300 BCE), are mythical, lacking historical support, unlike Jesus’ documented life (e.g., Roman records, Tacitus, 116 CE). Karma’s endless rebirths contradict Hebrews 9:27’s one life and judgment, trapping followers in a hopeless cycle far from Jehovah’s resurrection hope. Practices like venerating stupas (Sanchi Stupa, 300 BCE) and prayer wheels (Tibetan, 7th century CE) mirror pagan idol worship, which Jehovah condemns (Exodus 20:5). The doctrine of dependent origination (500 BCE), claiming all phenomena arise interdependently, lacks evidence and contradicts Genesis 1:1’s clear statement that Jehovah created all things directly, showing a mythical foundation. In Mahayana Buddhism (1st century CE), Buddha was deified, with statues like the Leshan Giant Buddha (713 CE) treated as divine, clashing with Deuteronomy 4:15-16’s ban on making images for worship. Meditation practices like Vipassana (500 BCE) focus on self-enlightenment, ignoring Jehovah’s judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14), leading to a self-centered path far from His standards. Buddhism’s mythical origins and pagan practices keep followers in spiritual darkness.</p><br><p><em>“You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.” —Revelation 4:11</em></p><br><p><em>“It is appointed for men to die once and after this to receive a judgment.” —Hebrews 9:27</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not bow down to them or be enticed to serve them.” —Exodus 20:5</em></p><br><p><em>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” —Genesis 1:1</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not make an image of anything in the heavens above.” —Deuteronomy 4:15-16</em></p><br><p><em>“God will bring every deed into judgment.” —Ecclesiastes 12:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Hinduism: A Polytheistic Mythical Maze</strong></p><br><p>Hinduism’s many gods—Vishnu, Shiva—clash with Exodus 20:3, its Vedas (1200 BCE) pushing reincarnation against Genesis 3:19’s dust return and Cambrian sudden life (540 million years ago). Angkor Wat (1100 CE) lacks rebirth proof, veiling Jehovah’s light. The Mahabharata and Ramayana (1200 BCE) depict gods like Krishna in mythical battles, resembling Greek myths (Iliad, 1200 BCE), with no historical basis, unlike Jehovah’s acts (Exodus, 1513 BCE). The caste system, from the Rigveda (1200 BCE), enforces hierarchy as divine, contradicting Galatians 3:28’s equality in Christ, perpetuating injustice Jehovah abhors (Proverbs 22:22-23). Worshipping creation—rivers (Ganges), animals (cows)—since Vedic times (1500 BCE), exchanges Jehovah’s truth for a lie (Romans 1:25), focusing on creation over the Creator. The concept of avatars, like Vishnu’s ten incarnations (e.g., Matsya, the fish, Puranas, 300 CE), is a mythical narrative with no historical basis, contrasting with Jehovah’s unchanging nature (Malachi 3:6). The Upanishads (800 BCE) teach pantheism, claiming all is divine, contradicting Isaiah 45:5’s declaration that Jehovah alone is God, leading to a fragmented worldview. Animal worship, like snakes during Nag Panchami (1500 BCE), stems from superstition, defying Leviticus 19:26’s ban on omens, showing Hinduism’s pagan roots far from Jehovah’s truth. Hinduism’s myths and idolatry keep followers in darkness.</p><br><p><em>“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</em></p><br><p><em>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, you are all one in union with Christ Jesus.” —Galatians 3:28</em></p><br><p><em>“They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated the creation rather than the Creator.” —Romans 1:25</em></p><br><p><em>“I, Jehovah, do not change.” —Malachi 3:6</em></p><br><p><em>“I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.” —Isaiah 45:5</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not look for omens.” —Leviticus 19:26</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Islam: Denial of Jehovah’s Ransom</strong></p><br><p>Islam’s Allah omits Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3), denying his death (Quran 4:157), with Muhammad’s 610 CE revelations tied to the pagan Kaaba (Ibn Hisham, 800 CE) and a flat-earth hint (Quran 71:19) lagging Job 26:7. It misses Jehovah’s plan. The Kaaba’s black stone, kissed during Hajj, predates Islam (pagan worship since 200 CE, Ibn Hisham), with circumambulation rituals echoing Arabian idolatry, which Jehovah forbids (Deuteronomy 4:15-19). The Quran’s creation account (41:9-12), claiming the earth in two days and mountains set after, contradicts Genesis 1:31’s orderly six-day creation, diverging from Jehovah’s truth. Belief in jinn (Quran 72:1-15), from pre-Islamic folklore (500 CE), resembles pagan spiritism, which Leviticus 19:31 forbids as defiling Jehovah’s people. The Night Journey (Quran 17:1, 621 CE), where Muhammad allegedly traveled to Jerusalem and ascended to heaven, lacks historical evidence and mirrors Persian myths (Arda Viraf’s journey, 400 CE), showing Islam’s mythical influences. Sharia law, developed from the 8th century CE (Hanafi school), imposes harsh punishments like stoning, contradicting Jesus’ mercy in John 8:7, straying from Jehovah’s balanced justice. Ramadan fasting (since 624 CE), while disciplined, often focuses on communal feasting (Iftar) rather than spiritual growth, missing Jehovah’s call for heartfelt worship (Isaiah 58:6-7). Islam’s pagan roots and myths lead followers far from Jehovah’s light.</p><br><p><em>“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</em></p><br><p><em>“He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.” —Job 26:7</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not turn to the spirit mediums or inquire of the fortune-tellers.” —Leviticus 19:31</em></p><br><p><em>“Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone.” —John 8:7</em></p><br><p><em>“Is not this the fast that I choose: to release the bonds of wickedness?” —Isaiah 58:6</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not make for yourself an image in the form of anything.” —Deuteronomy 4:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Sikhism: A Syncretic Mythical Blend</strong></p><br><p>Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century CE in Punjab, claims one god (Ik Onkar) but blends Hindu and Islamic ideas, rejecting Jesus as the only way (John 14:6). The Guru Granth Sahib (1604 CE) includes hymns from other faiths, promoting syncretism, which 2 Corinthians 6:14 forbids as being “unevenly yoked.” Sikh rituals, like the Amrit ceremony (1699 CE), involve drinking sweetened water stirred with a dagger, a man-made tradition lacking Scriptural basis, mirroring pagan rites. The Golden Temple (1577 CE) in Amritsar, adorned with gold, focuses on outward splendor, not Jehovah’s simple worship (John 4:23). Sikhism’s karma and reincarnation teachings, inherited from Hinduism, contradict Hebrews 9:27’s one life and judgment, rooting the faith in myths far from Jehovah’s truth. Sikhs revere their ten gurus as near-divine, with the Guru Granth Sahib treated as a living guru since 1708 CE, clashing with Matthew 23:8’s command to call no man “leader,” as Christ alone is the leader. The Khanda symbol (20th century CE), with its swords and circle, echoes ancient warrior cults (Rajput traditions, 1000 CE), lacking Scriptural basis and tying Sikhism to pagan militarism far from Jehovah’s peace (John 16:33). The communal kitchen (langar), while charitable (since 1499 CE), prioritizes social equality over preaching Jehovah’s Kingdom (Matthew 24:14), diverting focus from spiritual truth. Sikhism’s syncretism and mythical traditions keep followers far from Jehovah’s light.</p><br><p><em>“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” —John 14:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” —2 Corinthians 6:14</em></p><br><p><em>“It is appointed for men to die once and a miracle for men to after this receive a sacrifice.” —Hebrews 9:27</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be called ‘Leader,’ for your Leader is one, the Christ.” —Matthew 23:8</em></p><br><p><em>“I have said these things to you so that by means of me you may have peace.” —John 16:33</em></p><br><p><em>“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” —Matthew 24:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Taoism: An Impersonal Mythical Path</strong></p><br><p>Taoism, based on Laozi’s 4th-century BCE <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, worships the impersonal “Tao” (the Way), ignoring Jehovah as the personal Creator (Revelation 4:11). Its polytheistic practices, like venerating the Jade Emperor (a deity since the 9th century CE), clash with Exodus 20:3’s command for exclusive worship of Jehovah. Taoist alchemy, seeking immortality through elixirs (Han Dynasty, 200 BCE), often using mercury, contradicts Genesis 3:19’s return to dust, reflecting mythical quests like those of ancient Chinese emperors (e.g., Qin Shi Huang, 221 BCE). Temples like the White Cloud Temple (Beijing, 8th century CE) host rituals with incense and spirit offerings, akin to pagan idolatry Jehovah condemns (Exodus 20:5). Practices like feng shui (Han Dynasty, 200 BCE) rely on arranging spaces for “good energy,” a superstition akin to divination, which Leviticus 19:26 forbids, showing its mythical divergence from Jehovah’s truth. Ancestor veneration, through offerings at altars (Qingming Festival, 700 CE), mirrors pagan spiritism, defying Deuteronomy 18:10-11’s miracle on banishment of consulting the dead, leading believers far from Jehovah. The pursuit of physical immortality through internal alchemy (Zhang Daoling’s sect, 142 CE) is a myth, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 states the dead are conscious of nothing, contradicting Jehovah’s resurrection miracle. Taoism’s focus on nature’s balance over Jehovah’s sovereignty leads believers far from His truth.</p><br><p><em>“You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.” —Revelation 4:11</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not bow down to them or be enticed to serve them.” —Exodus 20:5</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not look for omens.” —Leviticus 19:26</em></p><br><p><em>“There must not be found in you anyone who consults the dead.” —Deuteronomy 18:11</em></p><br><p><em>“The dead know nothing at all.” —Ecclesiastes 9:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Shinto: Pagan Kami Worship</strong></p><br><p>Shinto, Japan’s indigenous faith since the 8th century CE (<i>Nihon Shoki</i>), worships countless kami (spirits) in nature, like Amaterasu the sun goddess, defying Exodus 20:3’s exclusive devotion to Jehovah. Shrines like Ise Jingu (rebuilt every 20 years since 690 CE) host rituals with offerings and purification rites, resembling ancient animism, which Romans 1:25 condemns as venerating creation over the Creator. Shinto’s mythical origins, such as the creation of Japan by Izanagi and Izanami (from the <i>Kojiki</i>, 712 CE), lack historical evidence, mirroring Babylonian creation myths (Enuma Elish, 1200 BCE). Its lack of a central deity and focus on ritual purity over moral accountability ignores Jehovah’s judgment (Hebrews 9:27), keeping followers far from His truth. Emperor worship, as a divine descendant of Amaterasu (until 1945 CE, post-WWII), elevates humans to godlike status, contradicting Romans 3:23’s truth that all have sinned, far from Jehovah’s standards. Shinto festivals (matsuri), like the Kanamara Matsuri (fertility festival, 1600s CE), involve phallic worship and offerings, echoing Canaanite Baal worship (1200 BCE), which Jehovah condemns (Deuteronomy 12:31). Shinto lacks a moral framework, focusing on ritual purity (misogi water purification, 8th century CE) over ethical living, ignoring Jehovah’s call for justice and righteousness (Micah 6:8). Shinto’s pagan roots and myths lead followers far from Jehovah’s light.</p><br><p><em>“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</em></p><br><p><em>“They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated the creation rather than the Creator.” —Romans 1:25</em></p><br><p><em>“It is appointed for men to die once and after this to receive a judgment.” —Hebrews 9:27</em></p><br><p><em>“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not do the way they do for their gods.” —Deuteronomy 12:31</em></p><br><p><em>“To do what is right and just is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.” —Micah 6:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Baha’i Faith: Universalist Falsehood</strong></p><br><p>The Baha’i Faith, founded by Baha’u’llah in 19th-century Persia, claims to unite all religions, denying Jesus as the only way (John 14:6). Its universalist teachings, formalized in the <i>Kitab-i-Aqdas</i> (1873 CE), promote a “world commonwealth,” blending faiths, which 2 Corinthians 6:14 forbids as being “unevenly yoked.” Baha’i shrines, like the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa (built 1953 CE), focus on Baha’u’llah’s revelations, elevating him above Jesus, contradicting Acts 4:12’s sole salvation through Christ. Its belief in progressive revelation, viewing Baha’u’llah as the latest prophet, adds to Scripture, defying 2 Timothy 3:16’s sufficiency. Rooted in Islamic mysticism (e.g., Babism, 1844 CE), its syncretic myths lead followers away from Jehovah’s exclusive worship. Baha’is view Jesus’ resurrection as symbolic (Baha’u’llah’s teachings, 1863 CE), contradicting 1 Corinthians 15:17’s necessity of Christ’s literal resurrection for faith, undermining Jehovah’s plan. Advocacy for a global government (Kitab-i-Aqdas, 1873 CE) aligns with worldly systems, which John 18:36 rejects as Jesus’ Kingdom is “no part of this world.” Baha’is treat Baha’u’llah’s writings as equal to or above the Bible, defying Revelation 22:18-19’s warning against adding to Jehovah’s Word. The Baha’i Faith’s universalism and human inventions keep followers far from Jehovah’s truth.</p><br><p><em>“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” —John 14:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” —2 Corinthians 6:14</em></p><br><p><em>“There is no salvation in anyone else.” —Acts 4:12</em></p><br><p><em>“If Christ has not been raised up, your faith is useless.” —1 Corinthians 15:17</em></p><br><p><em>“My Kingdom is no part of this world.” —John 18:36</em></p><br><p><em>“If anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues written.” — Revelation 22:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Catholicism: Idolatry and Human Traditions</strong></p><br><p>Catholicism, rooted in 4th-century CE Rome, blends Scripture with paganism, praying to saints and Mary as mediators, defying 1 Timothy 2:5’s sole mediator, Jesus. Statues and icons, adorning basilicas like St. Peter’s since the 6th century, violate Exodus 20:4, mirroring Babylonian idol worship (2000 BCE). The rosary, formalized in 1215 CE, uses repetitive chants like pagan rituals, unlike Jesus嫌疑 prayer (Matthew 6:7-9). The Trinity, cemented at Nicaea (325 CE), contradicts John 17:3, naming Jehovah alone as God. Papal infallibility, declared in 1870, elevates human authority, nullifying Scripture, as Jesus condemned (Mark 7:13). Catholics celebrate Christmas (Saturnalia, 4th-century CE) and Easter (Eostre rites, 8th-century CE), ignoring 2 Corinthians 6:17’s call to separate. Their vast wealth, with Vatican assets in billions, and political alliances since Constantine’s 313 CE edict contrast Jesus’ humility (Matthew 8:20). Ornate clergy, with mitres and robes, mimic pagan priests, not Christ’s simplicity. Failure to preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20) disobeys Matthew 28:19-20, leaving followers in spiritual darkness. Catholic Crusades (1095-1291 CE) and Inquisition (13th-19th centuries) promoted violence, defying Jesus’ peace (John 16:33). Purgatory, formalized at the Council of Florence (1439 CE), and indulgences, peaking with Tetzel’s 16th-century sales, contradict Hebrews 9:27’s judgment after death. The Mass, a re-sacrifice of Christ since the Council of Trent (1545–1563 CE), defies Hebrews 10:10’s “once for all time” sacrifice. Mandatory priestly celibacy, enforced since 1139 CE, lacks Scriptural basis and opposes 1 Timothy 4:1-3’s warning against forbidding marriage. Mary as “Co-Redemptrix,” debated since the 14th century CE, undermines Acts 4:12’s salvation through Jesus alone. Canonizing saints, formalized by the 12th century CE, elevates humans, clashing with Romans 3:23’s truth that all have sinned. Catholicism’s traditions keep millions from Jehovah’s truth.</p><br><p><em>“There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:5</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not make for yourself a carved image.” —Exodus 20:4</em></p><br><p><em>“In vain they worship me, teaching commands of men as doctrines.” —Mark 7:13</em></p><br><p><em>“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</em></p><br><p><em>“It is appointed for men to die once and after this to receive a judgment.” —Hebrews 9:27</em></p><br><p><em>“We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.” —Hebrews 10:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Some will fall away from the faith, forbidding to marry.” —1 Timothy 4:1-3</em></p><br><p><em>“There is no salvation in anyone else.” —Acts 4:12</em></p><br><p><em>“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” —Romans 3:23</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Protestantism: Fragmented Doctrines and Worldly Ways</strong></p><br><p>Protestantism, sparked by Luther’s 1517 reformation, encompasses Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Anglicans, Lutherans, Quakers, Amish, Evangelicals, Anabaptists, and Reformed Churches, but retains Catholic errors. Most teach the Trinity, despite John 14:28’s clear statement, “the Father is greater than I.” Hellfire, rooted in Plato’s myths (400 BCE), contradicts Ezekiel 18:4’s truth that “the soul who sins will die.” Many engage in politics, wars, or social activism, ignoring Jesus’ neutrality (John 18:36). Pagan holidays—Christmas (Saturnalia) and Easter (8th-century CE Germanic rites)—defy 2 Corinthians 6:17. Over 33,000 denominations since the 16th century lack Jesus’ prayed-for unity (John 17:21). Most fail to preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20), disobeying Matthew 28:19-20. Their “Sola Scriptura” claim is undermined by creeds like the Westminster Confession (1646 CE), defying 2 Timothy 3:16-17’s sufficiency of Scripture. Clerical titles like “Reverend,” rooted in Catholic tradition, violate Matthew 23:8’s equality among brothers. Tithing, formalized in the 8th century CE, lacks New Testament support, clashing with 2 Corinthians 9:7’s voluntary giving.</p><br><p><strong>Baptists</strong></p><br><p>Baptists, emerging in the 1600s, stress believer’s baptism (Acts 8:36), but their “once saved, always saved” doctrine, from Calvin’s 1530s teachings, ignores James 2:17’s faith with works and Hebrews 10:26’s warning against deliberate sin. Political activism, like voting or supporting military, defies John 18:36. Paid clergy contrast Jesus’ unpaid ministry (Matthew 10:8). Sunday worship, from the 4th-century CE Council of Laodicea, ignores Exodus 20:8-11’s seventh-day command.</p><br><p><strong>Methodists</strong></p><br><p>Methodists, founded by John Wesley in the 1730s, ordain women clergy, violating 1 Timothy 2:12’s creation-based restriction. Infant baptism, from Anglican roots, contradicts Acts 8:36-38. Social justice, like poverty or climate initiatives, overshadows preaching Jehovah’s Kingdom (Matthew 24:14). Trinity and hellfire oppose John 17:3. Wesleyan perfectionism, claiming sinless perfection, contradicts 1 John 1:8. Ecumenical ties, like the World Methodist Council (1881), defy 2 Corinthians 6:14’s separation from false religion.</p><br><p><strong>Presbyterians</strong></p><br><p>Presbyterians, following Calvin’s 1530s reforms, teach predestination, denying Deuteronomy 30:19’s free will. Infant baptism, a 3rd-century CE tradition, ignores Acts 8:36-38. Trinity and political ties defy 1 Corinthians 11:3 and John 18:36. Covenant theology justifies infant baptism as a “covenant sign,” lacking Scriptural support (Acts 2:38). Formal Lord’s Supper rituals add unscriptural ceremonies, clashing with 1 Corinthians 11:25’s simplicity.</p><br><p><strong>Pentecostals</strong></p><br><p>Pentecostals, from the 1900s, emphasize tongues and emotionalism, contradicting 1 Corinthians 14:40’s orderly worship. Prosperity teachings and political activism defy Matthew 6:19-20 and John 18:36. Faith healing and modern miracles, from the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, ignore 1 Corinthians 13:8-10’s cessation of gifts. Love of money through prosperity focus risks ruin (1 Timothy 6:9-10).</p><br><p><strong>Seventh-day Adventists</strong></p><br><p>Seventh-day Adventists, founded in the 1860s by Ellen White, add White’s writings, defying 2 Timothy 3:16. Investigative judgment contradicts Hebrews 9:27. Limited preaching disobeys Matthew 28:19-20. Sabbath legalism, with dietary laws from White’s visions, adds to Scripture (Colossians 2:16). White’s failed predictions, like Christ’s 1840s return, fail Deuteronomy 18:22’s prophetic test.</p><br><p><strong>Anglicans</strong></p><br><p>Anglicans, formed in the 1530s, retain Catholic rituals like infant baptism, ignoring Acts 8:36-38. State church ties defy John 18:36. The Book of Common Prayer (1549 CE) includes unscriptural liturgies and prayers to saints, violating 1 Timothy 2:5. Monarchical allegiance, from Henry VIII’s 1534 break, loves the world (1 John 2:15).</p><br><p><strong>Lutherans</strong></p><br><p>Lutherans, from 1517, uphold infant baptism and consubstantiation, lacking Scriptural basis (Acts 8:36-38). Social programs over preaching ignore Matthew 24:14. Luther’s antisemitism, from writings like <i>On the Jews and Their Lies</i> (1543 CE), contradicts Romans 10:12. The Augsburg Confession (1530 CE) adds to Scripture, defying 2 Timothy 3:16.</p><br><p><strong>Quakers</strong></p><br><p>Quakers, from the 1650s, reject ordinances and clergy, contradicting Matthew 28:19’s baptism command, which Jesus himself fulfilled (Matthew 3:15-16). Pacifism and inner light focus ignore John 17:3. The “inner light” doctrine risks straying from Scripture’s authority (2 Peter 1:19-21).</p><br><p><strong>Amish</strong></p><br><p>Amish, from the 1690s, enforce man-made rules (e.g., shunning technology), defying Colossians 2:20-23. Isolationism contradicts Matthew 28:19-20. Shunning (<i>Meidung</i>), for minor infractions, lacks Scriptural balance (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15). German dialect worship hinders outreach, defying 1 Corinthians 14:9’s clear communication.</p><br><p><strong>Evangelicals</strong></p><br><p>Evangelicals, growing since the 20th century, focus on emotional altar calls, lacking Scriptural basis for salvation (Acts 2:38).

Prosperity gospel teachings, common in megachurches, contradict Matthew 6:24’s warning against serving wealth.</p><br><p><strong>Anabaptists</strong></p><br><p>Anabaptists, from the 1520s, reject infant baptism, aligning with Acts 8:36-38, but their communal living and pacifism often overshadow preaching (Matthew 28:19-20). Rejection of all oaths, based on a misreading of Matthew 5:34, ignores Jesus’ broader context (Matthew 5:17).</p><br><p><strong>Reformed Churches</strong></p><br><p>Reformed Churches, rooted in Calvin’s 1530s teachings, uphold predestination, denying Deuteronomy 30:19’s free will. Their amillennialism, rejecting a literal Kingdom, contradicts Revelation 20:4’s thousand-year reign. Clerical hierarchy defies Matthew 23:8.</p><br><p><em>“The Father is greater than I am.” —John 14:28</em></p><br><p><em>“The soul who sins is the one who will die.” —Ezekiel 18:4</em></p><br><p><em>“My Kingdom is no part of this world.” —John 18:36</em></p><br><p><em>“Now I urge you, brothers, to be in full agreement.” —1 Corinthians 1:10</em></p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.” —2 Timothy 3:16</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be called ‘Leader,’ for your Leader is one, the Christ.” —Matthew 23:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Each one should give as he has decided in his heart.” —2 Corinthians 9:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Orthodox Christianity: Ritualistic Idolatry</strong></p><br><p>Eastern Orthodoxy, split from Catholicism in 1054 CE, venerates icons, like 6th-century CE mosaics in Hagia Sophia, violating Exodus 20:5’s ban on bowing to images. Their Trinity and immortal soul doctrines, from 4th-century CE councils like Constantinople (381 CE), contradict John 14:28 (“the Father is greater than I”) and Ecclesiastes 9:10 (“no work in the Grave”). Ornate clergy, with gilded vestments and beards, act as intermediaries, ignoring John 14:6’s sole way, Jesus. They rarely preach house-to-house, disobeying Matthew 28:19-20’s command to make disciples globally. Christmas (Saturnalia) and Easter (fertility cults) taint worship, defying John 4:23’s spirit and truth. Mysticism, like 14th-century CE hesychast prayer from Mount Athos, seeks experiences over Jehovah’s Word, echoing pagan spiritualism. Orthodoxy’s ties to national governments, as in Russia’s state church since the 988 CE baptism of Rus, entangle them in worldly conflicts, defying Jesus’ neutrality (John 18:36). Their veneration of relics, like saints’ bones, mirrors 3rd-century CE pagan practices, not Christ’s teachings. Prayers to saints on feast days, like St. Basil’s on January 1, rooted in 4th-century CE traditions, violate 1 Timothy 2:5, as Jesus alone mediates. Infant baptism, practiced since the 3rd century CE, and the sign of the cross lack Scriptural basis, clashing with Acts 8:12’s requirement of belief for baptism. The Eucharist’s literal transformation into Christ’s body and blood, formalized by the 11th century CE, contradicts John 6:54’s symbolic meaning and Leviticus 17:14’s ban on blood consumption. Monasticism, like Mount Athos since the 10th century CE, and asceticism promote withdrawal, yet Matthew 5:16 calls for active good works among people. Placing “Holy Tradition” from councils (325–787 CE) over Scripture defies 2 Timothy 3:16’s sufficiency. By prioritizing ritual over active ministry, Orthodoxy fails to guide followers to Jehovah’s Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“You must not bow down to them or be enticed to serve them.” —Exodus 20:5</em></p><br><p><em>“I am the way and the truth and the life.” —John 14:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations.” —Matthew 28:19</em></p><br><p><em>“The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.” —John 4:23</em></p><br><p><em>“There is one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:5</em></p><br><p><em>“When they heard and believed, they were baptized.” —Acts 8:12</em></p><br><p><em>“You must not eat the blood of any sort of flesh.” —Leviticus 17:14</em></p><br><p><em>“Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works.” —Matthew 5:16</em></p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching.” —2 Timothy 3:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Mormonism: False Scriptures and Polytheism</strong></p><br><p>Mormonism, founded by Joseph Smith in the 1820s, adds the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price to the Bible, defying 2 Timothy 3:16’s declaration that Scripture is sufficient. Their belief in three separate gods (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) and that men can become gods of their own worlds contradicts John 17:3, naming Jehovah alone as God, and echoes Satan’s lie (Genesis 3:5). Works-based salvation through secret temple rituals, practiced since the 1830s in Nauvoo, opposes Ephesians 2:8-9’s grace by faith. They celebrate Christmas (Saturnalia, 4th-century CE) and Easter, ignoring 2 Corinthians 6:17’s call to separate. Missionary work, limited to young men for two years, fails Matthew 24:14’s universal preaching command. Polygamy, practiced until 1890, and closed temple ceremonies, unlike Jesus’ open teachings (John 18:20), stray from Bible truth. Baptisms for the dead and focus on genealogy lack Scriptural basis, diverting from Jehovah’s worship (John 4:23). Mormonism’s wealth, with billions in assets, and corporate structure contrast Jesus’ humility (Matthew 8:20), misleading followers from the narrow path. They claim a restored priesthood through Smith in 1829, yet Hebrews 7:24 affirms Jesus’ unchangeable priesthood, needing no restoration. The belief in a premortal existence and eternal progression to godhood, taught in their scriptures, defies Isaiah 43:10, which says no gods exist before or after Jehovah. Elevating Smith as a prophet whose words add to the Bible ignores Deuteronomy 18:20’s warning against false prophets who lead away from Jehovah. The Book of Abraham, part of the Pearl of Great Price, claimed as Abraham’s writings, is proven by Egyptologists to be a 1st-century BCE funerary text, exposing Smith’s deception. Their doctrine of a Heavenly Mother introduces goddess worship, lacking Scriptural support and clashing with Deuteronomy 6:4’s monotheism. Mormonism’s teachings lead followers away from Jehovah’s truth.</p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching.” —2 Timothy 3:16</em></p><br><p><em>“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” — John 17:3</em></p><p><em>“By grace you have been saved through faith.” —Ephesians 2:8</em></p><br><p><p><em>“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</em></p><br><p><p><em>“Jesus has become a priest forever.” —Hebrews 7:24</em></p><br><p><p><em>“Before me no God was formed, and after me there has been none.” —Isaiah 43:10</p><br><em><p>“If a prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah and the word does not come true, that is the word that Jehovah did not speak.” —Deuteronomy 18:20</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah’s our God is one Jehovah.” —Deuteronomy 6:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Old Apostolic Lutherans: Exclusivism and Rituals</strong></p><br><p><strong>p>Old Apostolic Lutherans, a a 19th-century century Finnish-American American sect, sect claim exclusive preaching salvation, defying defying John John 14:14:6, 6 where where Jesus is is the only way. Infant baptism, practiced since their 1870 s founding during Finland’s revivalist movement, contradicts Acts 8:36-38’s requirement of conscious belief. Ritualistic services, with confessions to elders and strict gender roles (e.g., women covering hair, men leading), mirror Catholic traditions, not Jesus’ simple gatherings (Acts 20:7). They teach Trinity and hellfire, opposing 1 Corinthians 11:3 (Jehovah above Christ) and Ezekiel 18:4 (“the soul who sins will die”). Their inward focus, shunning modern practices like television or higher education, fails Matthew 28:19-20’s global preaching command. Rooted in Laestadianism, their isolationism fosters division, not the unity Jesus prayed for (John 17:21). Large families, often 10+ children, are prioritized over ministry, unlike Jesus’ focus on spiritual family (Mark 3:35). Their man-made rules, like dress codes, echo Pharisee traditions, condemned by Jesus (Matthew 23:4). They reject modern medicine and technology, like vaccinations or internet use, ignoring 1 Timothy 5:23’s approval of practical care. Confessing sins to elders for forgiveness, a tradition since the 1870s, bypasses 1 John 1:9’s direct confession to Jehovah. Their reliance on elders’ interpretations over personal Bible study contrasts with Acts 17:11’s example of daily Scriptural examination. Pacifism and avoidance of civic duties, like voting, conflict with Romans 13:1-2’s subjection to authorities. Traditional hymns dominate services, minimizing Scriptural preaching, neglecting 2 Timothy 4:2’s command to preach the word. By neglecting Jehovah’s truth and active worship, they leave followers spiritually adrift, far from the narrow path to life (Matthew 7:14).</p><br><p><em>“I am the way and the truth and the life.” —John 14:6</em></p><br><p><em>“The head of the Christ is God.” —1 Corinthians 11:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations.” —Matthew 28:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother.” —Mark 3:35</em></p><br><p><em>“Use a little wine because of your stomach.” —1 Timothy 5:23</em></p><br><p><em>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us.” —1 John 1:9</em></p><br><p><em>“They examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” —Acts 17:11</em></p><br><p><em>“Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities.” —Romans 13:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Preach the word; be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times.” —2 Timothy 4:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Christian Scientists: Denial of Reality</strong></p><br><p>Christian Scientists, founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879, teach that illness and sin are illusions, contradicting Jesus’ healing of real diseases (Matthew 8:16) and acknowledgment of sin (John 8:11). Eddy’s <i>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures</i>, added to the Bible, defies 2 Timothy 3:16’s sufficiency. Their denial of Jesus’ ransom and vague, Trinity-like views oppose 1 Timothy 2:5 and John 17:3, naming Jehovah as the only true God. Rejecting medical care, even for serious conditions, ignores Luke 5:31, where Jesus likened himself to a physician. Limited preaching, through reading rooms and lectures, disobeys Matthew 28:19-20’s global disciple-making command. While avoiding pagan holidays aligns with truth, their focus on mental healing, rooted in 19th-century New England idealism, strays from Jehovah’s practical worship (John 4:23). They deny matter’s reality, a core tenet since 1875, contradicting Genesis 1:31, where Jehovah declares His creation “very good.” Redefining sin, death, and resurrection as mental states undermines 1 Corinthians 15:17’s literal resurrection of Christ. Rejecting ordinances like baptism and communion, viewing them as symbolic since the 1880s, defies Matthew 28:19 and 1 Corinthians 11:24-25. Relying on practitioners for healing through prayer, established by Eddy in the 1880s, bypasses direct prayer to Jehovah (James 5:14-15). Universal salvation, denying judgment, opposes Hebrews 9:27’s accountability to Jehovah. Their church, with declining membership since the 20th century, emphasizes Eddy’s teachings over Scripture, misleading followers into denying physical reality and neglecting Jehovah’s provisions for health and salvation. By prioritizing philosophy over Bible truth, Christian Scientists fail to guide souls to the narrow path (Matthew 7:14).</p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.” —2 Timothy 3:16</em></p><br><p><em>“Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” —Luke 5:31</em></p><br><p><em>“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” —John 17:3</em></p><br><p><em>“There is one God, and one mediator between God and men.” —1 Timothy 2:5</em></p><br><p><em>“God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.” —Genesis 1:31</em></p><br><p><em>“If Christ has not been raised up, your faith is useless.” —1 Corinthians 15:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Do this in remembrance of me.” —1 Corinthians 11:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Call the elders of the congregation to you, and let them pray over you.” —James 5:14</em></p><br><p><em>“It is appointed for men to die once and after this to receive a judgment.” —Hebrews 9:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Non-Denominational Churches: Worldly Compromise</strong></p><br><p>Non-denominational churches, surging since the 1970s, claim independence but compromise with the world. They teach Trinity and hellfire, ignoring John 17:3’s sole true God, Jehovah, and Ezekiel 18:4’s truth that “the soul who sins will die.” Worship with rock bands, light shows, and casual services, common in megachurches since the 1980s, mimics worldly entertainment, not Acts 20:7’s orderly meetings. Prosperity teachings, like those of Joel Osteen, defy Matthew 6:19-20’s call for heavenly treasures, promoting materialism over spiritual riches. They rarely preach house-to-house, neglecting Matthew 28:19-20’s disciple-making command. Approving politics, war, or immoral lifestyles (e.g., same-sex marriage, accepted in many since the 2000s) violates James 4:4’s separation from the world. Their “feel-good” focus, warned against in 2 Timothy 4:3-4, avoids hard truths for popularity, echoing ancient Israel’s false prophets (Jeremiah 23:16). Lack of oversight leads to inconsistent teachings, defying 1 Corinthians 1:10’s unity in thought. Emotional altar calls, popularized since Billy Graham’s 1940s crusades, oversimplify salvation, ignoring Acts 2:38’s repentance and baptism. Ecumenical engagement, like the Willow Creek Association (1992), yokes them with false religions, against 2 Corinthians 6:14. Prioritizing personal experiences, like “feeling the Spirit,” over Scripture, a trend since the 1980s, risks straying from 2 Peter 1:19-21’s Scriptural authority. Tithing and seed-faith giving, as taught by leaders like Creflo Dollar since the 1990s, exploit followers, defying 2 Corinthians 9:7’s voluntary giving. By blending with culture, non-denominational churches fail to uphold Jehovah’s standards, leaving followers vulnerable to Satan’s lies and far from the narrow path to life (Matthew 7:14).</p><br><p><em>“They will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled.” —2 Timothy 4:3-4</em></p><br><p><em>“Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” —James 4:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth.” —Matthew 6:19-20</em></p><br><p><em>“Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations.” —Matthew 28:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Now I urge you, brothers, to be in full agreement.” —1 Corinthians 1:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Repent, and let each one of you be baptized.” —Acts 2:38</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” —2 Corinthians 6:14</em></p><br><p><em>“We have the prophetic word made more sure.” —2 Peter 1:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Each one should give as he has decided in his heart.” —2 Corinthians 9:7</em></p>

        <p><strong>Born in Bethlehem</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Born in Bethlehem</strong></p><br><p>Long before Jesus was born, the Hebrew prophet Micah wrote that the promised Messiah would come from a very specific place: the small town of Bethlehem in Judah. This prophecy was given around 700 years before Jesus’ birth and identified not only the location—but also emphasized that the ruler would come “from ancient times,” showing he would have a prehuman existence.</p><br><p><em>“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, the one too little to be among the thousands of Judah, from you will come out for me the one to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from ancient times, from the days of long ago.” —Micah 5:2</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Was Born in Bethlehem, Just as Foretold</strong></p><br><p>The Gospel of Matthew confirms that Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the days of King Herod. This was no accident—Jehovah directed events so that Mary and Joseph would be in Bethlehem at just the right time. Although they lived in Nazareth, a Roman census required them to travel to Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy exactly.</p><br><p><em>“After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look! astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem.” —Matthew 2:1</em></p><br><p><em>“So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem… to get registered with Mary.” —Luke 2:4-5</em></p><br><p><strong>The Chief Priests Knew This Prophecy Too</strong></p><br><p>When King Herod heard about the birth of “the king of the Jews,” he asked the chief priests where the Messiah was supposed to be born. They immediately quoted Micah’s prophecy, showing that even the religious leaders at the time understood the significance of Bethlehem.</p><br><p><em>“They said to him: ‘In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is how it has been written through the prophet.’” —Matthew 2:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Born of a Virgin</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Born of a Virgin</strong></p><br><p>Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to give a remarkable prophecy. Isaiah wrote that a virgin—someone who had not had relations with a man—would give birth to a son. This miraculous birth would be a sign from God and a powerful proof of the Messiah’s divine origin.</p><br><p><em>“Therefore, Jehovah himself will give you a sign: Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel.” —Isaiah 7:14</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus’ Birth Fulfilled This Prophecy Exactly</strong></p><br><p>About 700 years after Isaiah wrote this prophecy, Jehovah caused it to be fulfilled. The angel Gabriel told the virgin Mary that she would give birth to a son by means of holy spirit. This would not be a normal birth. Joseph, her legal husband, did not have sexual relations with her until after Jesus was born. Jehovah was the one who caused Mary to become pregnant.</p><br><p><em>“But she said to the angel: ‘How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?’ The angel answered her: ‘Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son.’” —Luke 1:34-35</em></p><br><p><strong>Matthew Directly Connects This to Isaiah’s Prophecy</strong></p><br><p>Matthew, one of Jesus’ apostles, clearly shows that this event fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy. By quoting it directly, he helps us see that this was no coincidence. Jehovah guided the whole event so that the Messiah’s birth would be a miraculous sign, just as foretold.</p><br><p><em>“All of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: ‘Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,’ which means, when translated, ‘With Us Is God.’” —Matthew 1:22-23</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Rejected by Men</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Rejected by Men</strong></p><br><p>Centuries before Jesus’ time, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to describe how the Messiah would be treated by others. Instead of being honored and respected, he would be rejected, despised, and viewed as insignificant by the people. This prophecy accurately foretold how the Jewish nation, especially its leaders, would treat Jesus when he came.</p><br><p><em>“He was despised and was avoided by men, a man who was meant for pains and was familiar with sickness. It was as if his face were hidden from us. He was despised, and we held him as of no account.” —Isaiah 53:3</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Was Rejected by His Own People</strong></p><br><p>Although Jesus taught with authority, performed miracles, and showed deep compassion, he was rejected by the majority of people, especially the religious leaders. They accused him of misleading the nation and even of being demon-possessed. Many people turned their backs on him, and even his own relatives didn’t believe in him at first.</p><br><p><em>“He came to his own home, but his own people did not accept him.” —John 1:11</em></p><br><p><em>“For neither did his brothers put their faith in him.” —John 7:5</em></p><br><p><strong>The Leaders Plotted Against Him and Stirred Up the Crowd</strong></p><br><p>Instead of recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah, the chief priests and Pharisees became jealous of him. They rejected his message and plotted to have him killed. They even stirred up the crowd to demand his execution, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would be “held as of no account.”</p><br><p><em>“However, the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar·abʹbas, but to have Jesus put to death.” —Matthew 27:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Betrayed for 30 Pieces of Silver</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Betrayed for 30 Pieces of Silver</strong></p><br><p>Over 500 years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Zechariah to record a very specific prophecy: the Messiah would be valued at just 30 pieces of silver—the price of a common slave—and that money would later be thrown into the temple and given to a potter. This prophecy foreshadowed the betrayal of Jesus and even what would happen to the money afterward.</p><br><p><em>“So they paid me 30 pieces of silver. Then Jehovah said to me: ‘Throw it into the treasury—the magnificent value with which they valued me.’ So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of Jehovah.” —Zechariah 11:12-13</em></p><br><p><strong>Judas Iscariot Fulfilled This Prophecy Exactly</strong></p><br><p>Judas, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles, agreed to betray Jesus to the chief priests for the exact amount foretold: 30 pieces of silver. This was a shocking act of disloyalty, and it fulfilled Zechariah’s prophecy with stunning detail. Judas later felt deep regret and returned the money, but the priests refused to accept it back into the temple treasury.</p><br><p><em>“Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Is·carʹi·ot, went to the chief priests and said: ‘What will you give me to betray him to you?’ They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces. So from then on, he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him.” —Matthew 26:14-16</em></p><br><p><em>“Then he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed. After that he went away and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: ‘It is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.’” —Matthew 27:5-6</em></p><br><p><strong>The Money Was Used to Buy a Potter’s Field</strong></p><br><p>Just as Zechariah’s prophecy said, the silver was used to buy a field from a potter. This detail might have seemed small or unlikely when the prophecy was first written, but it came true exactly.</p><br><p><em>“So they conferred together and used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.” —Matthew 27:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Silent Before His Accusers</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Remain Silent Before His Accusers</strong></p><br><p>Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to write about how the Messiah would respond during his trial. Instead of defending himself with angry words or fighting to prove his innocence, the prophecy said the Messiah would remain silent, like a lamb being led to the slaughter.</p><br><p><em>“He was hard-pressed and was letting himself be afflicted; yet he would not open his mouth. He was being brought just like a sheep to the slaughtering; and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth.” —Isaiah 53:7</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Fulfilled This Prophecy Perfectly</strong></p><br><p>When Jesus stood before the Jewish high priest, King Herod, and Roman Governor Pontius Pilate, he was falsely accused by religious leaders. Many lies were spoken about him. Yet Jesus remained calm and quiet, just as Isaiah had foretold. He did not fight back or try to escape his arrest. His silence showed his complete trust in Jehovah’s purpose and timing.</p><br><p><em>“But Jesus kept silent.” —Matthew 26:63</em></p><br><p><em>“But he did not answer him, not even a word, so that the governor was very surprised.” —Matthew 27:14</em></p><br><p><em>“But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.” —Mark 15:5</em></p><br><p><strong>His Silence Fulfilled Jehovah’s Will</strong></p><br><p>Jesus knew that defending himself would not stop what had to happen. He trusted Jehovah completely and fulfilled the role of the “Lamb of God,” willingly offering his life to provide a ransom for mankind.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Pierced</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Pierced</strong></p><br><p>Hundreds of years before Jesus’ death, Jehovah inspired prophets to write specific details about how the Messiah would suffer. One of those key prophecies described that the Messiah would be pierced, an exact detail that was fulfilled in Jesus’ death.</p><br><p><em>“They will look to the one whom they pierced, and they will mourn over him as one mourns over an only son…” —Zechariah 12:10</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Was Literally Pierced on the Stake</strong></p><br><p>When Jesus was executed, he was nailed through his hands and feet, causing extreme pain and fulfilling this prophecy. Even more directly, after he had died, a Roman soldier pierced his side with a spear, just as Zechariah had foretold.</p><br><p><em>“Instead, one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” —John 19:34</em></p><br><p><em>“In fact, these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled: ‘Not a bone of his will be broken.’ And again, a different scripture says: ‘They will look to the one whom they pierced.’” —John 19:36-37</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Cast Lots for His Garments</strong></p><br><p><strong>They Would Cast Lots for His Garments</strong></p><br><p>Long before Jesus was born, King David was inspired by Jehovah to write a psalm that described the Messiah’s suffering in detail. One striking part of that prophecy spoke about Jesus’ clothing being divided—and about men casting lots to win part of it.</p><br><p><em>“They divide my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.” —Psalm 22:18</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus’ Garments Were Divided by Roman Soldiers</strong></p><br><p>When Jesus was nailed to the stake, the Roman soldiers took his clothes. They divided most of them, but when they came to his inner garment—woven in one piece—they decided not to tear it. Instead, they cast lots to see who would get it, just as the prophecy had said.</p><br><p><em>“When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the stake, they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts… But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from top to bottom. So they said to one another: ‘Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be.’ This was to fulfill the scripture: ‘They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.’” —John 19:23-24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Bones Not Broken</strong></p><br><p><strong>Not One of His Bones Would Be Broken</strong></p><br><p>As Jesus hung on the stake, it was prophesied that his bones would remain unbroken—a striking detail that was fulfilled perfectly. This prophecy was given by Jehovah long before Jesus’ birth, demonstrating the precision of God’s Word.</p><br><p><em>“He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken.” —Psalm 34:20</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus’ Bones Remained Unbroken</strong></p><br><p>At the time of Jesus’ execution, Roman soldiers usually broke the legs of the condemned men to hasten their deaths. But when they came to Jesus, they found that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs. This fulfilled the prophecy that not a bone of the Messiah would be broken.</p><br><p><em>“The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been nailed to the stake with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. However, one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” —John 19:32-34</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Buried in a Rich Man’s Tomb</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Buried in a Rich Man’s Tomb</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah didn’t just foretell how the Messiah would live and die—He even foretold how and where Jesus would be buried. This too was fulfilled in detail when Jesus was laid in the tomb of a wealthy man.</p><br><p><em>“And he will make his burial with the wicked, and with the rich in death, although he had done no wrong and there was no deception in his mouth.” —Isaiah 53:9</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Was Buried in the Tomb of a Rich Man</strong></p><br><p>After Jesus died, a rich man named Joseph of Arimathea, who was also a secret disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate for permission to bury him. He placed Jesus in his own new tomb, which had never been used before.</p><br><p><em>“When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea came… He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him. And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean, fine linen, and laid it in his new tomb, which he had quarried in the rock.” —Matthew 27:57-60</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Resurrected</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Be Resurrected</strong></p><br><p>The resurrection of Jesus is one of the most faith-strengthening events in all of Bible history. But did the Bible actually foretell it before it happened? Yes—it did! Jehovah inspired prophecies that clearly pointed to the Messiah’s resurrection from the dead.</p><br><p><em>“For you will not leave me in the Grave. You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.” —Psalm 16:10</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Was Raised to Life on the Third Day</strong></p><br><p>After Jesus died, he was placed in the tomb. But on the third day, Jehovah raised him from the dead, just as foretold. The apostles later quoted Psalm 16 to prove this prophecy had been fulfilled in Jesus.</p><br><p><em>“God resurrected this Jesus, and of this we are all witnesses… For David, on the one hand, did not ascend to the heavens.” —Acts 2:32, 34</em></p><br><p><em>“But God resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held fast by it.” —Acts 2:24</em></p><br><p><em>“He foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in the Grave nor did his flesh see corruption.” —Acts 2:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Sit at God’s Right Hand</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Sit at God’s Right Hand</strong></p><br><p>After Jesus was raised from the dead, his work on earth was not yet complete. The Bible had foretold that the Messiah would return to heaven and be exalted to a position of great authority—at Jehovah’s right hand. This prophecy showed that Jesus would be honored and given kingly power.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah declared to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” —Psalm 110:1</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Ascended to Heaven and Took His Place</strong></p><br><p>After Jesus’ resurrection, he appeared to his disciples for 40 days and then ascended to heaven. From there, he waited at Jehovah’s right hand until it was time for him to begin ruling as King.</p><br><p><em>“He is at God’s right hand, for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.” —1 Peter 3:22</em></p><br><p><em>“Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands… but into heaven itself, now to appear before God on our behalf.” —Hebrews 9:24</em></p><br><p><em>“After he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.” —Hebrews 1:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Ruling in the Last Days</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Messiah Would Begin Ruling in the Last Days</strong></p><br><p>Jesus did not begin ruling as King immediately after ascending to heaven. The Bible foretold that the Messiah would sit at Jehovah’s right hand until the appointed time—when he would begin ruling in the midst of his enemies. This would happen during the “last days” of this world system.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah will stretch out the scepter of your power from Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’” —Psalm 110:2</em></p><br><p><strong>Jesus Began Ruling in 1914</strong></p><br><p>Based on Bible chronology, Jehovah’s Witnesses understand that this prophecy began to be fulfilled in 1914, when Jesus was given Kingdom authority in heaven. That marked the beginning of the last days of this world and the start of his rule as King.</p><br><p><em>“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed… It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.” —Daniel 2:44</em></p><br><p><em>“Then I saw in the visions of the night, and look! with the clouds of the heavens, someone like a son of man was coming… To him were given rulership, honor, and a kingdom, so that the peoples, nations, and language groups should all serve him.” —Daniel 7:13-14</em></p><br><p>Since 1914, we have seen clear evidence of this prophecy’s fulfillment—including war, famine, disease, and unrest—just as Jesus foretold in Matthew 24. His heavenly Kingdom has begun, and soon, it will bring an end to all human rule.</p>
        <br><p><strong>The Lamb and the Seven Seals</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Lamb and the Seven Seals Represent</strong></p><br><p>In the book of Revelation, the Lamb represents Jesus Christ, who is central to God’s purpose of bringing salvation and establishing God’s Kingdom. The Lamb is called so because of Jesus’ sacrifice as a perfect ransom to pay for the sins of humanity. His role is to open the seven seals on the scroll, unveiling God’s judgments upon the world.</p><br><p><em>“But one of the elders said to me: ‘Do not weep! Look! The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.’ And I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.” —Revelation 5:5-6</em></p><br><p><strong>The Role of the Lamb</strong></p><br><p>The Lamb (Jesus Christ) is the only one worthy to open the seals because of his perfect obedience and sacrificial death. Without his sacrifice, no one could be reconciled to God or receive salvation. As the Lamb, Jesus unveils God’s judgments on the world by opening each seal, revealing what will take place in the last days.</p><br><p><em>“And I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll, written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice: ‘Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?’” —Revelation 5:1-2</em></p><br><p><strong>The Seven Seals and Their Significance</strong></p><br><p>The Seven Seals represent the unfolding of God’s judgment on the world. Each seal reveals a significant event that will take place as God’s Kingdom approaches, culminating in the final battle at Armageddon. These seals, opened by Jesus Christ, reveal various aspects of the tribulation that precede God’s Kingdom replacing human rule.</p><br><p><strong>The First Seal: The White Horse (Christ’s Kingdom Proclamation)</strong></p><br><p>The first seal represents the spreading of Christ’s Kingdom message. This is not a military conquest, but a spiritual conquest through the preaching of the good news. Christ’s rule is established in the hearts of individuals worldwide.</p><br><p><em>“Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder: ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.” —Revelation 6:1-2</em></p><br><p><strong>The Second Seal: The Red Horse (War)</strong></p><br><p>The second seal reveals war and violence. This represents the conflicts and instability that will erupt as part of the last days, demonstrating the growing turmoil in the world.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, ‘Come!’ And another horse, fiery red, went out. And to its rider was given the power to take peace from the earth, and that people should slay one another; and a large sword was given to him.” —Revelation 6:3-4</em></p><br><p><strong>The Third Seal: The Black Horse (Famine)</strong></p><br><p>The third seal represents famine and economic hardship, a consequence of the wars and the collapse of political and economic systems. Scarcity will grow, affecting the availability of food and resources.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and the wine!’” —Revelation 6:5-6</em></p><br><p><strong>The Fourth Seal: The Pale Horse (Death)</strong></p><br><p>The fourth seal symbolizes death as a result of war, famine, and disease. The rider on the pale horse, named Death, and Hades follow, representing widespread death and destruction that will take place.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.” —Revelation 6:7-8</em></p><br><p><strong>The Fifth Seal: The Souls Under the Altar (Martyrdom)</strong></p><br><p>The fifth seal represents the martyrdom of faithful servants of God who suffer persecution for their stand for the truth. These martyrs cry out for justice, asking God how long they will have to wait before the wicked are punished.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, ‘How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?’” —Revelation 6:9-10</em></p><br><p><strong>The Sixth Seal: The Great Earthquake (Cosmic Disturbances)</strong></p><br><p>The sixth seal heralds a great earthquake and cosmic upheavals, including signs in the heavens and a shaking of the earth. These natural disasters will be a clear sign that God’s judgment is near.</p><br><p><em>“I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.” —Revelation 6:12-14</em></p><br><p><strong>The Seventh Seal: Silence in Heaven (Preparation for the Final Judgment)</strong></p><br><p>The seventh seal opens with silence in heaven for about half an hour. This silence marks the solemn preparation for the final judgment, and it sets the stage for the seven trumpets, which announce the final stages of God’s judgment.</p><br><p><em>“And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.” —Revelation 8:1</em></p><br><p><strong>The Meaning of the Seven Seals</strong></p><br><p>The Seven Seals are not events happening all at once but represent a series of prophetic signs leading to the establishment of God’s Kingdom. They outline the major tribulations that will unfold, such as war, famine, and death, followed by the persecution of God’s people. The final seal introduces cosmic disturbances, preparing the world for the final battle at Armageddon.</p><br><p><em>“And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.” —Revelation 8:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Four Horsemen</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Four Horsemen</strong></p><br><p>The Four Horsemen are a vivid and powerful symbol in the book of Revelation. They represent a series of catastrophic events that will occur during the last days, as part of God’s judgment upon the world. Each horseman is described riding a different-colored horse, each bringing different types of destruction to the earth.</p><br><p><strong>The First Horseman: The White Horse</strong></p><br><p>The first horseman rides a white horse, symbolizing conquest and the spread of Christ’s message. The rider holds a bow and is given a crown, symbolizing victory. This event is not a military conquest but a spiritual one, as the message of God’s Kingdom is proclaimed to the world.</p><br><p><em>“Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder: ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.” —Revelation 6:1-2</em></p><br><p><strong>The Second Horseman: The Red Horse</strong></p><br><p>The second horseman rides a red horse, symbolizing war and bloodshed. This rider is given a great sword, representing the violence and conflicts that will spread across the world. War will be a major feature of the last days, leading to widespread destruction and suffering.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, ‘Come!’ And another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was granted the power to take peace from the earth, and to make people slay each other. He was given a large sword.” —Revelation 6:3-4</em></p><br><p><strong>The Third Horseman: The Black Horse</strong></p><br><p>The third horseman rides a black horse, symbolizing famine and economic hardship. The rider holds a pair of scales, symbolizing the need to ration food due to scarcity. This represents the worldwide economic instability that will accompany the wars and upheavals of the last days.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, ‘Come!’ And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine!’” —Revelation 6:5-6</em></p><br><p><strong>The Fourth Horseman: The Pale Horse</strong></p><br><p>The fourth horseman rides a pale horse, symbolizing death and destruction. The rider is named Death, and Hades follows him, symbolizing the vast number of people who will die as a result of war, famine, and disease during this time. The pale horse represents the devastating consequences of the other horsemen.</p><br><p><em>“When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, ‘Come!’ So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.” —Revelation 6:7-8</em></p><br><p><strong>The Meaning of the Four Horsemen</strong></p><br><p>The Four Horsemen represent the tribulations that will occur as the world nears its end. These events, including spiritual conquest, war, famine, and death, will set the stage for the final judgment. They show the severity and scope of the problems that humanity will face, as God’s Kingdom prepares to take its place and bring lasting peace. Each of these four horsemen heralds a particular aspect of God’s judgment, each leading to greater unrest and destruction. However, these events also point to the coming Kingdom of God, which will ultimately bring an end to all this suffering.</p>
        <br><p><strong>The Scarlet-Colored Beast</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Scarlet-Colored Beast</strong></p><br><p>In the book of Revelation, the scarlet-colored beast is a key symbol used to represent political systems and their involvement in persecuting God’s people. This beast is described as having seven heads and ten horns, and it is ridden by a woman, symbolizing a corrupt religious-political alliance.</p><br><p><strong>What Does the Scarlet-Colored Beast Represent?</strong></p><br><p>The scarlet-colored beast symbolizes an end-time political system that is empowered by Satan and opposed to God’s Kingdom. It represents a world system of political powers that, under Satan’s influence, seek to suppress true worship and work in alliance with false religion. The seven heads of the beast represent seven world powers that have dominated history, while the ten horns represent ten kings or rulers who share authority with this beast.</p><br><p><em>“And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.” —Revelation 17:3</em></p><br><p><strong>The Seven Heads</strong></p><br><p>The seven heads of the beast represent seven world powers, each of which had a significant impact on God’s people. Historically, these powers are typically identified as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the Anglo-American dual world power. Each of these powers played a role in oppressing Jehovah’s people, culminating in the modern political alliances that continue to challenge God’s Kingdom today.</p><br><p><strong>The Ten Horns</strong></p><br><p>The ten horns of the beast represent ten kings or rulers who will give their power to the beast in the final days. These rulers are symbolic of governments or coalitions that will unite in opposition to God’s Kingdom. This alliance will be part of the global political system that persecutes God’s people during the final years of this world system.</p><br><p><em>“And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they are to receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.” —Revelation 17:12</em></p><br><p><strong>The Woman on the Beast</strong></p><br><p>The woman who rides the scarlet-colored beast represents false religion, specifically the world empire of false religion known as “Babylon the Great.” She is described as a harlot, symbolizing how false religion has become corrupt and has aligned itself with political powers to persecute true worshipers.</p><br><p><em>“The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She had a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.” —Revelation 17:4</em></p><br><p><strong>The Beast’s Destruction</strong></p><br><p>Despite its temporary power, the scarlet-colored beast and the false religious system that rides it will be destroyed by God’s Kingdom. In the final battle of Armageddon, God’s judgment will be poured out on this corrupt system, and it will be replaced by the establishment of God’s everlasting Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“The ten horns you saw… will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.” —Revelation 17:16-17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Eight Kings</strong></p><br><p><strong>Human World Powers in Bible Prophecy</strong></p><br><p>In Revelation 17:10, the apostle John is told:</p><br><p><em>“They are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet arrived, but when he does arrive he must remain a short while.” —Revelation 17:10</em></p><br><p>These “kings” represent political world powers that have directly affected Jehovah’s people throughout history. The prophecy refers not to individual rulers, but to successive empires that dominate the earth and interact with God’s people from ancient times to the modern day. The Bible identifies eight such “kings.”</p><br><p><strong>The Five That Had Fallen</strong></p><br><p>1. Egypt<br>Egypt was the first major world power to oppress God’s people, enslaving the Israelites for centuries. Jehovah humbled Egypt and freed his people by means of miraculous plagues.</p><br><p><em>“By this you will know that I am Jehovah. I am going to strike the water of the Nile…and it will turn into blood.” —Exodus 7:17</em></p><br><p>2. Assyria<br>Assyria conquered the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel and exiled its people. But Jehovah foretold and brought about Assyria’s end.</p><br><p><em>“I will make Nineveh desolate, as dry as the desert.” —Zephaniah 2:13</em></p><br><p>3. Babylon<br>Babylon conquered Judah and destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. But Jehovah also foretold Babylon’s swift fall.</p><br><p><em>“In that very night Belshazzar…was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom.” —Daniel 5:30-31</em></p><br><p>4. Medo-Persia<br>Jehovah used the Persian king Cyrus to end Babylon’s rule and allow His people to return home.</p><br><p><em>“This is what Jehovah says…‘I will stir up Cyrus…to open doors before him.’” —Isaiah 45:1</em></p><br><p>5. Greece<br>The Greek Empire under Alexander the Great fulfilled prophecy by quickly conquering Medo-Persia.</p><br><p><em>“The male goat…struck down the ram…and trampled it down.” —Daniel 8:7</em></p><br><p><strong>The Sixth King: Rome</strong></p><br><p>The sixth king “is,” meaning Rome was in power during John’s time. Rome ruled with brutality and persecution, even executing Jesus and oppressing early Christians.</p><br><p><em>“They led him away to be executed…They fastened him to the stake.” —Luke 23:26, 33</em></p><br><p>Rome eventually weakened and fell in 476 C.E., paving the way for the next king.</p><br><p><strong>The Seventh King: Anglo-American World Power</strong></p><br><p>This seventh king is a dual power—Britain and the United States—ruling together especially since World War I. It is during the time of this seventh king that God’s Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914.</p><br><p><em>“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom…It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms.” —Daniel 2:44</em></p><br><p>But this power will not last long. It will eventually give way to the eighth king.</p><br><p><strong>The Eighth King: The United Nations</strong></p><br><p>The scarlet-colored beast of Revelation 17 symbolizes the United Nations. It is not a separate world power, but a coalition representing global political unity.</p><br><p><em>“The wild beast…is also himself an eighth king, but springs from the seven.” —Revelation 17:11</em></p><br><p>This eighth king exists during the time of the seventh and has no real power of its own—except what is given to it. Jehovah will allow the United Nations and its supporters to carry out His purpose by attacking Babylon the Great, false religion.</p><br><p><em>“These will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated…For God put it into their hearts to carry out His thought.” —Revelation 17:16-17</em></p><br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Sovereignty Over All Kings</strong></p><br><p>The rise and fall of these eight kings proves that no human government can stand against Jehovah’s will. All of them have been used—or allowed—to fulfill God’s prophecies. But in the end, all human rulership will be replaced by the everlasting Kingdom of God.</p><br><p><em>“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom…It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms.” —Daniel 2:44</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Peace and Security</strong></p><br><p><strong>A Declaration From World Leaders, Not From God</strong></p><br><p>The Bible foretells a specific event that will occur just before the great tribulation begins—a global proclamation of “Peace and Security.” The apostle Paul wrote:</p><br><p><em>“Whenever it is that they are saying, ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them, just like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape.” —1 Thessalonians 5:3</em></p><br><p>This message will not come from Jehovah or his people. Instead, it will be declared by political, religious, and international leaders who believe they’ve achieved stability in the world. They may see it as the beginning of a new era of peace, perhaps connected to the United Nations, the symbolic “eighth king” mentioned in the book of Revelation.</p><br><p><strong>A False Hope Before the Collapse</strong></p><br><p>The cry of “Peace and Security” may bring celebration and a false sense of hope to the world. Leaders might point to peace treaties, economic cooperation, or diplomatic breakthroughs. But Jehovah sees through this illusion. It will not be true peace. Just as the world begins to feel secure, sudden destruction will begin—starting with the fall of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion.</p><br><p><em>“These will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire. For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought.” —Revelation 17:16-17</em></p><br><p><strong>A Clear Warning for Jehovah’s People</strong></p><br><p>For Jehovah’s servants, this announcement is not a time to relax. Jesus warned his followers to stay alert. He said:</p><br><p><em>“Pay attention to yourselves… Keep awake, then, all the time, making supplication… that you may succeed in escaping all these things.” —Luke 21:34-36</em></p><br><p>The “Peace and Security” declaration is a clear sign for Jehovah’s people. They will recognize it as a prophetic marker, showing that Jehovah’s day is about to begin. This is why God’s people are encouraged to stay awake spiritually and to keep proclaiming the good news while there is still time.</p><br><p><strong>The Final Warning Before the Storm</strong></p><br><p>This false proclamation of peace will serve as the final calm before the storm. It signals that Jehovah’s judgment is about to begin. Just as labor pains strike suddenly and grow more intense, the destruction of this world’s system will begin abruptly and move quickly. The sudden downfall of false religion will mark the start of the great tribulation. After that, Jehovah will bring judgment upon the rest of the world’s political, military, and economic powers, clearing the way for the full establishment of his Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” —Daniel 2:44</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Tribulation</strong></p><br><p><strong>A Time of Distress Unlike Any Other</strong></p><br><p>Jesus foretold that the Great Tribulation would be unlike anything the world has ever experienced. He said:</p><br><p><em>“Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” —Matthew 24:21</em></p><br><p>This is not just another time of war or disaster. It is the first major phase of Jehovah’s final judgment on this system of things. No previous event in history compares to what will happen during this period, and it will never be repeated. Jehovah Himself initiates it, demonstrating His justice and holiness.</p><br><p><strong>What Triggers the Great Tribulation?</strong></p><br><p>The Great Tribulation is triggered after the symbolic cry of “Peace and Security.” Though this announcement will seem like a turning point for global stability, it is quickly followed by a shocking event—Jehovah allows the political powers to destroy Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion.</p><br><p><em>“The ten horns… and the wild beast will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked… and they will completely burn her with fire.” —Revelation 17:16</em></p><br><p>The destruction of false religion is not random—it is part of Jehovah’s will. He puts it into the hearts of world leaders to carry it out.</p><br><p><strong>Jehovah’s People Are Spared</strong></p><br><p>Though the Great Tribulation is a time of judgment, Jehovah protects His people. They are not part of Babylon the Great and have remained separate from false worship. Jesus assured his followers:</p><br><p><em>“If those days were not cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” —Matthew 24:22</em></p><br><p>This means that Jehovah will intervene before the tribulation can wipe out all life. His people, often referred to as the “great crowd,” will be preserved because they stay loyal and clean in Jehovah’s eyes. Their survival is a powerful testimony to Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p>
        <br><p><strong>666 — The Mark of the Beast</strong></p><br><p><strong>666 — The Mark of the Beast</strong></p><br><p>666 is the number, or name, of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that comes out of the sea.</p><br><p><em>“And it stood still on the sand of the sea. And I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems, but on its heads blasphemous names.” —Revelation 13:1</em></p><br><p><em>“This is where it calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number, and its number is 666.” —Revelation 13:18</em></p><br><p>This beast is a symbol of the worldwide political system.</p><br><p><em>“It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.” —Revelation 13:7</em></p><br><p>The name 666 identifies the political system as a gross failure in God’s sight.</p><br><p><strong>The Significance of 666</strong></p><br><p>Seven typically represents completeness or perfection. Six, being one short of seven, can denote something incomplete or flawed in God’s eyes, and it can be associated with God’s enemies. The Bible sometimes stresses a matter by stating it three times.</p><br><p><em>“As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. And continuously, day and night, they say: ‘Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.’” —Revelation 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: ‘Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!’” —Revelation 8:13</em></p><br><p>So the name 666 powerfully emphasizes that God views human political systems as gross failures. They have been unable to bring lasting peace and security—things that only God’s Kingdom will achieve.</p><br><p><strong>The Mark of the Beast</strong></p><br><p>But, the beast with seven heads that comes out of the water isn’t the only thing under the name 666. The mark of the beast is also tied into the name. But what is the mark of the beast, and how do some get the mark of the beast? The Bible indicates that people receive “the mark of the wild beast” because they follow it with admiration, ultimately leading to worship.</p><br><p><em>“I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration. And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: ‘Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?’” —Revelation 13:3, 4</em></p><br><p><em>“The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image.” —Revelation 16:2</em></p><br><p><strong>Worshipful Honor to the Political System</strong></p><br><p>Those who receive the mark of the beast give worshipful honor to their country, its symbols, or its military might. As stated in The Encyclopedia of Religion, “Nationalism has become a dominant form of religion in the modern world.”</p><br><p><strong>The Mark on the Right Hand or Forehead</strong></p><br><p>How is the mark of the beast placed on someone’s right hand or forehead?</p><br><p><em>“It puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead.” —Revelation 13:16</em></p><br><p>In contrast, God’s commands to the nation of Israel were to be internalized, not literally marked on their hands and foreheads.</p><br><p><em>“You must impress these words of mine on your heart and your soul and bind them as a reminder on your hand, and they should be like a headband on your forehead.” —Deuteronomy 11:18</em></p><br><p>This meant that God’s words would guide all their actions and thoughts.</p><br><p><strong>The Symbolic Meaning of the Mark</strong></p><br><p>Rather than a literal mark, such as a 666 tattoo, the mark of the beast symbolically identifies those who let the political system rule their lives.</p><br><p><strong>Opposition to God</strong></p><br><p>Those with the mark of the beast place themselves in opposition to God.</p><br><p><em>“Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: ‘If anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.’” —Revelation 14:9, 10</em></p><br><p><em>“And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army. And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur. But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.” —Revelation 19:19-21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Fall of Babylon the Great</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Judgment of False Religion Begins</strong></p><br><p>Babylon the Great is a symbol of the world empire of false religion. For centuries, false religion has misled people, opposed Jehovah, and allied itself with political powers. During the Great Tribulation, Jehovah will finally bring judgment against this system. It will be the first visible sign that this world is collapsing.</p><br><p><em>“She fell! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons.” —Revelation 18:2</em></p><br><p>This global collapse of false religion will shock people everywhere. Religious institutions that seemed unshakable will be devastated as Jehovah allows political powers to turn against them.</p><br><p><em>“She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a place for demons to dwell, a haunt for every unclean spirit… for all the nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.” —Revelation 18:2</em></p><br><p><strong>How Will Babylon the Great Fall?</strong></p><br><p>The symbolic “ten horns” (political powers) and the scarlet-colored wild beast (the United Nations) will unexpectedly turn on false religion. They will destroy her wealth, power, and global influence. The very governments that once supported her will now bring her to ruin.</p><br><p><em>“The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.” —Revelation 17:16</em></p><br><p>These governments will think they’re acting in their own interest—perhaps to bring peace or security—but in truth, Jehovah is guiding these events to accomplish His purpose.</p><br><p><em>“God put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose, yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God will have been accomplished.” —Revelation 17:16-17</em></p><br><p><strong>Why Does Jehovah Allow This Destruction?</strong></p><br><p>False religion has long misrepresented Jehovah and harmed people spiritually and physically. It has supported wars, promoted immorality, and taught lies about God. Now Jehovah will remove it forever. The fall of Babylon the Great is not an accident—it is His righteous judgment.</p><br><p><em>“Come out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:4</em></p><br><p>Jehovah’s people have already obeyed this command. They are not part of Babylon the Great. That is why they are not harmed when she falls. Her destruction begins the final countdown for this system.</p><br><p><em>“Get out of her, my people, so that you do not share with her in her sins and so that you do not receive part of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:4</em></p><br><p><strong>The World Will Mourn—But Jehovah’s People Will Rejoice</strong></p><br><p>Many will grieve when Babylon the Great falls, especially those who profited from her—politicians, merchants, and religious leaders. But Jehovah’s people will rejoice, knowing this judgment proves that Jehovah is cleansing the earth.</p><br><p><em>“Be glad over her, O heaven, and you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!” —Revelation 18:20</em></p><br><p>Her end will be permanent. False religion will never rise again. Jehovah’s justice will be complete.</p><br><p><em>“With a swift pitch, a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: ‘This is how Babylon the great city will be hurled down, and she will never be found again.’” —Revelation 18:20-21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Gog of Magog</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Final Attack Against Jehovah’s People</strong></p><br><p>After the fall of Babylon the Great, the world will enter its most dangerous moment. The political powers, no longer distracted by false religion, will now unite in an all-out attack on Jehovah’s people. The Bible refers to this global attack as the assault by Gog of Magog.</p><br><p><em>“You will come against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the final part of the days, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me.” —Ezekiel 38:16</em></p><br><p>This prophecy is not about ancient Israel. It points to Jehovah’s present-day people—those who have dedicated themselves to Him and are standing firm during the Great Tribulation. The world, under Satan’s control, will now attempt to wipe them out completely.</p><br><p><em>“You will come against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the final part of the days, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I sanctify myself through you before their eyes, O Gog.” —Ezekiel 38:16</em></p><br><p><strong>Who Is Gog of Magog?</strong></p><br><p>Gog of Magog is not a single human or nation. It is a symbolic name for the combined forces of this world, united under Satan after the fall of false religion. These include kings, rulers, military powers, and global institutions who are deceived into thinking they can defeat God’s people.</p><br><p><em>“They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons… to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14</em></p><br><p>Satan uses these powers to gather the nations for one final rebellion. But what appears to be a unified military campaign is actually the beginning of their destruction.</p><br><p><em>“They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14</em></p><br><p><strong>Why Does Gog Attack Jehovah’s People?</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s people will be the only organized group left standing in support of God’s Kingdom. Without Babylon the Great, and with global systems in chaos, Jehovah’s servants will seem vulnerable—peaceful, unarmed, and without political protection. Gog will believe this is the perfect opportunity.</p><br><p><em>“You will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unprotected settlements… to loot and plunder.’” —Ezekiel 38:11-12</em></p><br><p>But Jehovah sees this attack coming. He will allow Gog to advance—but only so far. Then Jehovah will respond with decisive power, showing the nations that they have gone too far.</p><br><p><em>“You will say, ‘I will go up against the land of unprotected settlements… against people gathered from the nations, who are dwelling in security, all of them living without a wall.’” —Ezekiel 38:11-12</em></p><br><p><strong>Jehovah Responds to Gog’s Attack</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah will not allow His people to be destroyed. Just as Gog’s forces close in, Jehovah will intervene in the most powerful way. The Bible says He will act with rage, using natural and supernatural forces to protect His people and strike down their enemies.</p><br><p><em>“My great rage will flare up… I will call for a sword against him… torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur.” —Ezekiel 38:18-22</em></p><br><p>This overwhelming response will begin the final phase of the Great Tribulation. It will be clear to all who is truly in control. Jehovah will sanctify His name before the eyes of the world.</p><br><p><em>“In that day, my great rage will flare up… I will call for a sword against him… And I will bring my judgment against him with pestilence and bloodshed; and I will rain down a torrential downpour and hailstones and fire and sulfur.” —Ezekiel 38:18-22</em></p><br><p><strong>This Leads Directly to Armageddon</strong></p><br><p>The attack by Gog of Magog sets the stage for the war of Armageddon. As the nations fight against Jehovah’s people, Jehovah’s King—Jesus Christ—will take action. With the heavenly armies, Jesus will strike down all enemies of God’s Kingdom.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Armageddon</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Beginning of Armageddon</strong></p><br><p>Armageddon begins when Satan’s world system, represented by the UN (8th king) and the Anglo-American powers (7th king), launches a final attempt to crush Jehovah’s people—the Great Crowd—after the destruction of Babylon the Great. The nations of the world, under Gog of Magog, will unite in opposition to God’s Kingdom, thinking they can wipe out Jehovah’s faithful ones.</p><br><p><em>“They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14</em></p><br><p>At the start of this event, Jehovah’s heavenly army (including Jesus Christ and the 144,000) will begin to intervene, bringing judgment upon the wicked and providing protection for the faithful. In this first stage, it will be clear that Jehovah’s Kingdom is established, and the destruction of false religion has already set the stage for the final battle.</p><br><p><em>“They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” —Revelation 16:14</em></p><br><p><strong>The Middle of Armageddon: The Battle and Judgment</strong></p><br><p>The middle of Armageddon is marked by direct divine intervention. The heavenly forces, led by Jesus Christ, will defeat all of Satan’s armies, including the political, military, and religious forces opposed to God’s Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. The one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.” —Revelation 19:11</em></p><br><p>Jesus Christ’s victory over the forces of Satan at the height of Armageddon will be decisive. The beast and the false prophet—symbols of corrupt religion and corrupt political systems—will be destroyed and cast into the lake of fire. This phase also includes the Judgment of the Sheep and the Goats, marking the division between those who serve Jehovah faithfully (the sheep) and those who oppose His Kingdom (the goats). The righteous will be rewarded with eternal life, while the wicked will face destruction.</p><br><p><em>“When the Son of man comes in his glory… all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” —Matthew 25:31-32</em></p><br><p><em>“And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. The one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.” —Revelation 19:11</em></p><br><p><strong>The End of Armageddon: Final Destruction and Peace</strong></p><br><p>The final phase of Armageddon will see the complete defeat of all opposition to God’s Kingdom. The goats (the wicked) will be destroyed in judgment, and Jesus Christ will bring an end to all human rulership and the influence of Satan.</p><br><p><em>“These will wage war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.” —Revelation 17:14</em></p><br><p>At the conclusion of Armageddon, all the armies opposing Christ will be utterly defeated.</p><br><p><em>“These will wage war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.” —Revelation 17:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The End</strong></p><br><p><strong>The Destruction of Satan’s World System</strong></p><br><p>After Armageddon, the entire system that Satan has ruled—including all human governments, institutions, and his influence—will be completely removed.</p><br><p><em>“And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, the original serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:1-2</em></p><br><p>Satan and his demons will be bound and abyssed for 1,000 years, unable to mislead the nations during Christ’s Millennial Rule. The world will be free from the corruption and deception Satan has caused throughout human history.</p><br><p><em>“And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, the original serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.” —Revelation 20:1-2</em></p><br><p><strong>Christ’s 1,000-Year Reign Begins</strong></p><br><p>This marks the start of the Millennial Reign of Jesus Christ alongside the 144,000 anointed ones in heaven. Jehovah’s Kingdom will rule over the earth with righteousness, peace, and everlasting life.</p><br><p><em>“They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years.” —Revelation 20:6</em></p><br><p>During this time: Paradise will be restored on earth.</p><br><p><em>“They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.” —Isaiah 65:21</em></p><br><p>Righteous government will bring peace.</p><br><p><em>“In his days the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound until the moon is no more.” —Psalm 72:7</em></p><br><p>People will enjoy perfect health and everlasting life.</p><br><p><em>“They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years.” —Revelation 20:6</em></p><br><p><strong>The Resurrection of the Righteous and the Unrighteous</strong></p><br><p>During the 1,000 years, many who died faithful to Jehovah will be resurrected to life on a peaceful earth. Even those who did not know Jehovah will be given a chance to learn and choose His ways.</p><br><p><em>“Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” —John 5:28-29</em></p><br><p><em>“There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” —Acts 24:15</em></p><br><p><strong>Gradual Elimination of Imperfection</strong></p><br><p>During the 1,000 years, obedient humans will gradually be raised to perfection—physically, mentally, and spiritually. This process will restore what Adam and Eve lost.</p><br><p><em>“On either side of the river was the tree of life… and the leaves of the tree were for the curing of the nations.” —Revelation 22:1-2</em></p><br><p>The “trees of life” symbolize the healing and restoration available during this time, as humankind is gradually brought back to perfection.</p><br><p><em>“On either side of the river was the tree of life… and the leaves of the tree were for the curing of the nations.” —Revelation 22:1-2</em></p><br><p><strong>Final Test After the 1,000 Years</strong></p><br><p>After the 1,000 years, Satan will be released from the abyss for a short time and will try to mislead perfected humans.</p><br><p><em>“And when the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to mislead the nations.” —Revelation 20:7-8</em></p><br><p>Those who choose to follow Satan will be destroyed permanently. Then Satan himself will be destroyed forever—this is known as the second death.</p><br><p><em>“And when the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to mislead the nations.” —Revelation 20:7-8</em></p><br><p><strong>Jehovah Becomes “All Things to Everyone”</strong></p><br><p>After Satan’s destruction, Jesus hands the Kingdom back to Jehovah, and Jehovah becomes “all things to everyone.”</p><br><p><em>“Then comes the end, when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power.” —1 Corinthians 15:24</em></p><br><p>Jehovah will rule the universe directly, and all will recognize Him as King. All that is imperfect will have been removed, and peace will reign forever.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Word, faithfully preserved in the oldest Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts, shines as a beacon of truth through the New World Translation. This translation restores His sacred name and corrects centuries of errors in earlier translations, which often omitted “YHWH,” included uninspired texts, or introduced doctrinal biases. By returning to the purity of the original writings, the New World Translation guides the humble to everlasting life, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise that His truth endures forever.</p><br><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot and a light to my path.” —Psalm 119:105</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Hebrew Scriptures: Jehovah’s Name in the Oldest Writings</strong></p><br><p>The Hebrew Scriptures, the oldest writings of Jehovah’s inspired Word, were penned primarily in Hebrew, with some Aramaic sections, between approximately 1500 and 400 BCE. These dates are determined through paleographic analysis of ancient inscriptions, such as the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE), and radiocarbon dating of materials like the Silver Scrolls from Ketef Hinnom, dated to around 600 BCE. This collection, known as the Tanakh, includes 39 books divided into the Law (Torah), Prophets (Nevi’im), and Writings (Ketuvim). Moses began this sacred work, recording the Law after receiving divine instructions at Mount Sinai, including the Ten Commandments written by Jehovah’s own hand (Exodus 31:18). Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel later added their inspired messages, guided by holy spirit, ensuring Jehovah’s will was faithfully recorded, as affirmed by “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p><br><p>Central to these writings is Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” which appears 6,973 times, emphasizing its sanctity, as in “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). The Torah established laws for worship and morality, the Prophets delivered messages of judgment and hope, and the Writings offered wisdom and praise, such as in the Psalms. These texts, written on parchment or papyrus scrolls, were meticulously copied by scribes called Sopherim, who counted letters to ensure accuracy. Stored in synagogues and the temple, they were read aloud to the congregation, strengthening Israel’s covenant with Jehovah. Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls, tiny amulets inscribed with blessings invoking “YHWH,” confirm the name’s prominence in daily worship. These writings, free from uninspired additions, set the standard for divine truth, fulfilling “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” —Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Septuagint: Early Translation Retains Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>The Septuagint, or LXX, translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Koine Greek between 280 and 150 BCE, making Jehovah’s Word accessible to Greek-speaking Jews after Alexander the Great’s conquests spread Greek culture. Dating is established through paleographic analysis of early fragments like Papyrus Fouad 266, dated to the 2nd century BCE, and historical records of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who reportedly commissioned the work in Alexandria, Egypt. Tradition holds that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars completed the translation, ensuring fidelity to the Hebrew originals. Most significantly, early Septuagint copies retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters, resisting the later substitution of “Kyrios” (Lord), as seen in Papyrus Fouad 266, which includes Deuteronomy passages with the divine name intact, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p><br><p>The Septuagint included the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures but also added uninspired texts known as the Apocrypha, such as Tobit and Maccabees, which provide historical context but lack divine inspiration, as they were not part of the Hebrew canon. These additions, often moral or historical in nature, were later accepted by some religious traditions but were not considered scripture by early Jews or faithful Christians. The translation process involved careful comparison with Hebrew scrolls, though some interpretive choices emerged, such as rendering “almah” in Isaiah 7:14 as “parthenos” (virgin), impacting messianic prophecy. Used widely in synagogues, the Septuagint became the Bible of early Christians, quoted in the Christian Scriptures (e.g., Matthew 1:23). Its early retention of “YHWH” underscores its reverence for Jehovah’s name, fulfilling “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p><br><p><em>“This is my name forever.” —Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Codices: Jehovah’s Name Fades Amid Uninspired Additions</strong></p><br><p>The Early Codices, such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, were compiled between 325 and 350 CE, as confirmed by paleographic analysis of their uncial Greek script and radiocarbon dating of their vellum pages. These codices, transitioning from scrolls to bound books, were among the first complete Christian Bibles, containing the Septuagint (Old Testament) and the Christian Scriptures. Codex Sinaiticus, discovered at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now housed in the British Library, occasionally preserves “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotes, showing awareness of the name’s original presence. However, Codex Vaticanus, stored in the Vatican Library, more consistently uses “Kyrios” (Lord), reflecting a growing trend among scribes to avoid pronouncing the divine name due to Jewish traditions, a shift that obscured “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8).</p><br><p>These codices, produced during a time of doctrinal disputes and Roman persecution, also included uninspired additions. Codex Sinaiticus contains the Apocrypha, inherited from the Septuagint, and marginal notes by copyists, such as textual variants or commentary, which were not part of the inspired text. For example, Sinaiticus omits the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20), later added in other manuscripts, indicating early textual tampering. Vaticanus similarly lacks this passage and some pastoral epistles, reflecting variations in early transmission. Despite these issues, the codices preserved the core of Jehovah’s Word, serving as key manuscripts for later translations. Their creation by Christian scribes under pressure from apostasy highlights the challenge of maintaining purity, yet their endurance fulfills “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” —Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Latin Vulgate: Jehovah’s Name Replaced</strong></p><br><p>The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome between 382 and 405 CE, became the standard Bible of the Western Church, but it further distanced readers from Jehovah’s name. Historical records, including Jerome’s letters, and paleographic analysis of early Vulgate manuscripts, such as the Codex Amiatinus (dated to the early 8th century), confirm this timeline. Commissioned by Pope Damasus I, Jerome worked in Bethlehem, using Hebrew manuscripts for the Old Testament and Greek texts for the Christian Scriptures, revising earlier Old Latin translations. However, following the trend of the time, he replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord) throughout, influenced by Jewish and Christian traditions avoiding the divine name, a significant departure from “You, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p><br><p>The Vulgate included the 39 Hebrew Scripture books, the 27 Christian Scripture books, and the Deuterocanonical books (e.g., Tobit, Maccabees), inherited from the Septuagint but not inspired, as they were absent from the Hebrew canon. These uninspired texts were used for moral instruction but were not scripture. Jerome’s goal was to standardize scripture for the church’s liturgy, producing a unified Latin text for a multilingual empire. The Vulgate’s influence endured for centuries, shaping medieval theology and later translations like the King James Version. However, its removal of Jehovah’s name and inclusion of uninspired texts marked a step away from the original writings, though its preservation of the core message aligns with “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p><br><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot.” —Psalm 119:105</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls: Proof of Jehovah’s Name in the Oldest Writings</strong></p><br><p>The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, provided undeniable proof that the oldest writings prominently used Jehovah’s name, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). These 900+ manuscripts, written between 200 BCE and 70 CE—dated through carbon-14 analysis and paleographic study of their Hebrew script—include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a), one of the most complete, uses “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to highlight its sanctity, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” Written on parchment and papyrus, the scrolls were likely hidden by the Essenes, a Jewish sect, during the First Jewish-Roman War to protect them from Roman destruction.</p><br><p>The scrolls, now housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book and the Jordan Museum, reveal a community devoted to scriptural purity. They include biblical texts, sectarian writings (e.g., the Community Rule), and commentaries (e.g., Pesher Habakkuk), showing how the Essenes interpreted prophecy in anticipation of the end times. Unlike later manuscripts, these scrolls contain no uninspired Apocryphal texts or marginal notes, preserving the original Hebrew Scriptures’ integrity. Their text aligns closely with the Masoretic Text (e.g., Leningrad Codex, 1008 CE), with only minor variations, proving scribal accuracy over centuries. This discovery confirmed that Jehovah’s name was central to the oldest writings, countering later translations that omitted it, and set the stage for the New World Translation’s return to these pure sources, fulfilling “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p><br><p><em>“My words will not pass away.” —Matthew 24:35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Modern Translations: Reliance on Later Writings</strong></p><br><p>Early modern translations, from the Wycliffe Bible to the Revised Version, played a crucial role in making Jehovah’s Word accessible to the masses, breaking the Catholic Church’s monopoly on scripture and fostering spiritual awakening during the Reformation. However, their reliance on later manuscripts, omission of Jehovah’s name, and inclusion of uninspired texts introduced significant flaws, necessitating a translation like the New World Translation to restore the purity of the original writings.</p><br><p><strong>Wycliffe Bible (1382)</strong></p><br><p>The Wycliffe Bible, the first complete English Bible, translated by John Wycliffe, was a landmark in making scripture available in the vernacular, challenging the church’s Latin-only tradition. Handwritten copies were banned due to their reformist impact, marking an early step toward liberating God’s Word. However, it relied solely on the Latin Vulgate, which replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord), obscuring “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). This dependence on a secondary source introduced errors, as the Vulgate itself contained uninspired Deuterocanonical books and lacked the precision of the Hebrew originals, hindering the clarity of Jehovah’s truth.</p><br><p><strong>Tyndale Bible (1526)</strong></p><br><p>William Tyndale’s Bible, the first printed English Bible, advanced accessibility by using some Hebrew and Greek texts alongside the Vulgate. Tyndale’s pioneering use of “Jehovah” in passages like Exodus 6:3 was a significant step toward restoring the divine name. Yet, his reliance on the Textus Receptus, a later Greek compilation, included uninspired additions, such as the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20). Tyndale’s execution in 1536 limited his work’s scope, and his translation’s incomplete nature and outdated language restricted its accuracy, falling short of “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><br><p><strong>Geneva Bible (1560)</strong></p><br><p>The Geneva Bible, popular among Puritans, furthered the Reformation by providing an affordable, annotated Bible. Its study notes aided personal study, but these notes reflected Calvinist biases, introducing doctrinal errors. Like Tyndale, it relied on the Textus Receptus and used “LORD” instead of “Jehovah,” perpetuating the omission of the divine name. The inclusion of uninspired texts and interpretive commentary strayed from the original manuscripts, diminishing its fidelity to “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p><br><p><strong>King James Version (1611)</strong></p><br><p>The King James Version, commissioned by King James I, became a literary masterpiece, standardizing English scripture for centuries. It drew from the Textus Receptus and Vulgate, using “Jehovah” in only four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18) while favoring “LORD” elsewhere. Spurious passages, like 1 John 5:7 (the Johannine Comma), absent in early codices like Sinaiticus, were included, reflecting reliance on corrupted manuscripts. Its archaic language, such as “thee” and “thou,” confused later readers, and its failure to incorporate older manuscripts limited its accuracy, obstructing “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p><br><p><strong>Revised Version (1885)</strong></p><br><p>The Revised Version aimed to update the KJV by incorporating newer manuscripts, such as Westcott and Hort’s Greek text, improving textual accuracy. It retained “LORD” and inconsistent renderings, however, and failed to restore “YHWH” consistently. Its reliance on later sources and retention of uninspired texts perpetuated errors, underscoring the need for a translation grounded in the oldest writings.</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” —Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Modern Translations: Continued Errors</strong></p><br><p>Modern translations, from the American Standard Version to the English Standard Version, improved readability and incorporated newer manuscript discoveries, making Jehovah’s Word more accessible in contemporary language. However, their inconsistent handling of Jehovah’s name, retention of uninspired texts, liberal or paraphrased renderings, and reliance on later manuscripts perpetuated errors, highlighting the need for the New World Translation to provide a faithful, unbiased representation of the oldest texts.</p><br><p><strong>American Standard Version (1901)</strong></p><br><p>The American Standard Version was a significant step forward, restoring “Jehovah” in the Old Testament over 6,000 times, a bold move to honor “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Its literal approach aided serious study. However, it used “Lord” in New Testament quotations of the Old Testament, creating inconsistency, and relied on later manuscripts that retained uninspired additions, such as Mark 16:9-20, absent in Codex Sinaiticus. This diluted its accuracy and failed to fully restore the divine name’s prominence across both Testaments.</p><br><p><strong>Revised Standard Version (1952)</strong></p><br><p>The Revised Standard Version aimed for ecumenical appeal, using newer manuscripts like the Nestle-Aland Greek text. It rarely used “Jehovah,” favoring “LORD,” and its liberal renderings, such as translating “almah” in Isaiah 7:14 as “young woman” instead of “virgin,” weakened messianic prophecies critical to “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Its inclusion of questionable texts, like John 7:53–8:11, and reliance on later sources compromised its fidelity to the oldest writings.</p><br><p><strong>New American Standard Bible (1971)</strong></p><br><p>The New American Standard Bible prioritized literal accuracy, benefiting scholars and students. Yet, it used “LORD” throughout, omitting “YHWH,” and included uninspired passages, such as John 7:53–8:11, unsupported by early manuscripts like Papyrus P66. Its complex sentence structure also hindered accessibility for some readers, falling short of “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p><br><p><strong>New International Version (1978)</strong></p><br><p>The New International Version, with over 450 million copies distributed, achieved widespread popularity through its readable, dynamic-equivalence approach. However, it omitted “Jehovah” entirely, using “LORD,” and relied on paraphrasing, which sacrificed precision in passages like Romans 10:13. It retained additions like Mark 16:9-20, not found in the oldest manuscripts, straying from the purity of “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><br><p><strong>New King James Version (1982)</strong></p><br><p>The New King James Version modernized the KJV’s language while preserving its style, appealing to traditionalists. It retained the KJV’s errors, including “LORD” instead of “Jehovah” and spurious texts like 1 John 5:7, ignoring older manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus. Its adherence to the Textus Receptus limited its textual accuracy, failing to fully honor “You, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p><br><p><strong>English Standard Version (2001)</strong></p><br><p>The English Standard Version offered a literal yet readable text, drawing on the latest manuscript evidence. It used “LORD” consistently, omitting “YHWH,” and included questionable passages, such as the longer ending of Mark, not supported by early codices. Its evangelical bias in some renderings, like softening terms in passages about judgment, subtly altered meaning, hindering the clarity of “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p><br><p><em>“You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High.” —Psalm 83:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>New World Translation: Restoring the Original Truth</strong></p><br><p>The New World Translation (NWT), released in stages from 1950 to 1961 and revised in 2013, was created to address the cumulative errors of prior translations, which omitted Jehovah’s name, included uninspired texts, and relied on later manuscripts. By returning to the oldest Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, the NWT provides an unbiased and accurate representation of Jehovah’s inspired Word, fulfilling “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Its restoration of the divine name, exclusion of spurious passages, and use of clear, modern language have made it a vital tool for spreading Jehovah’s truth globally, with over 240 million copies in more than 200 languages.</p><br><p><strong>Restoration of Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>The NWT restores “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 instances in the Hebrew Scriptures and 264 in the Christian Scriptures where Old Testament quotations (e.g., Matthew 4:4 citing Deuteronomy 8:3) or context (e.g., Acts 2:21 citing Joel 2:32) indicate “YHWH” was originally used. Early Septuagint fragments, such as Papyrus Fouad 266, and Hebrew Gospel manuscripts, like Shem-Tob’s Matthew, confirm “YHWH”’s presence in 1st-century texts, but later scribes substituted “Kyrios” (Lord) due to traditions avoiding the divine name. The NWT corrects this error, ensuring consistency with “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6). Unlike translations that used “LORD” or inconsistently applied “Jehovah,” the NWT upholds the sanctity of God’s name across both Testaments, aligning with archaeological evidence like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE), which affirms “YHWH”’s prominence in ancient worship.</p><br><p><strong>Exclusion of Uninspired Texts</strong></p><br><p>The NWT excludes uninspired texts absent in the oldest manuscripts, such as Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, and Papyrus P46. Passages like 1 John 5:7 (the Johannine Comma), Mark 16:9-20, and John 7:53–8:11, which were likely marginal notes or glosses added by copyists, are omitted, preserving the inspired text’s integrity. Earlier translations, even modern ones, often retained these additions due to tradition or incomplete manuscript evidence, diluting “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). The NWT’s rigorous textual analysis ensures only divinely inspired content is included, addressing the flaws of its predecessors.</p><br><p><strong>Reliance on the Oldest Writings</strong></p><br><p>Inspired by discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls, which confirmed “YHWH”’s prominence in texts like the Great Isaiah Scroll, the NWT relies on the oldest available manuscripts: the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices for the Hebrew Scriptures and early Greek manuscripts, such as Papyrus P66 and P75, for the Christian Scriptures. Unlike early modern translations that depended on the corrupted Textus Receptus or the Latin Vulgate, or modern translations using later compilations like the Nestle-Aland text with lingering errors, the NWT prioritizes the most reliable sources. This commitment to textual purity counters the errors of translations swayed by ecclesiastical traditions or incomplete scholarship.</p><br><p><strong>Clear, Modern Language</strong></p><br><p>The NWT’s clear, modern language enhances accessibility, avoiding the archaic terms of the King James Version or the complex syntax of the New American Standard Bible. Precise renderings, such as “soul” instead of “spirit” in Genesis 2:7, reflect Hebrew and Greek terms accurately, clarifying doctrines obscured by prior translations’ vague or biased wording. Unlike the New International Version’s paraphrasing or the Revised Standard Version’s liberal interpretations, the NWT maintains fidelity to the original texts, ensuring “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p><br><p><strong>Scholarly Rigor</strong></p><br><p>The NWT’s translation process involved a committee of dedicated scholars who cross-referenced thousands of manuscripts, including the Masoretic Text, Septuagint fragments, and early codices, to avoid doctrinal bias. Unlike translations influenced by Trinitarian or denominational agendas, such as the English Standard Version’s evangelical leanings or the Geneva Bible’s Calvinist notes, the NWT prioritizes scriptural accuracy over tradition. Its revisions, particularly in 2013, incorporated advancements in textual criticism and archaeology, refining renderings to align with the oldest writings, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p>The NWT’s global impact underscores its necessity. Translated into over 200 languages and distributed in 240 million copies, it equips Jehovah’s Witnesses to preach in 240 lands, overcoming barriers like Russia’s 2017 ban. Unlike popular translations like the NIV, which sacrifice accuracy for readability, or the ASV, which faltered in consistency, the NWT combines scholarly rigor with practical clarity. Its restoration of Jehovah’s name, exclusion of uninspired texts, and reliance on the oldest manuscripts address the flaws of centuries of translations, making it the definitive tool for those seeking the truth of God’s Word, as “You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah (Isaiah 43:10).</p><br><p><em>“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. —Isaiah 43:10</em></p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s promises and His unshakable Kingdom stand firm, anchored by fulfilled prophecies, divine power, and the enduring truth of His Word. Through challenges like persecution, ridicule, and doubt, the faithful are equipped with unwavering strength to endure every trial, confidently preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). This certainty prepares them for a righteous new world, where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for everlasting life.</p><br><p><em>“Therefore, since we are receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe.” —Hebrews 12:28</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Enduring Persecution</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith enables true worshipers to endure persecution, as foretold: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted” (2 Timothy 3:12). Jesus commissioned His followers to “go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), warning them, “You will be hated by all people on account of my name” (Matthew 10:22). Despite Satan’s attacks, described as “the dragon became enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17), Jehovah promises, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10), ensuring strength to remain steadfast.</p><br><p>In 33 CE, Stephen faced martyrdom, yet “they could not stand up to his wisdom” (Acts 6:10), demonstrating unshakable faith. Like Stephen, faithful ones today heed the call to “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), separating from false religion. They pray, “Deliver me from my enemies, O Jehovah” (Psalm 59:1), and rely on Scripture, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their endurance aligns with the hope of “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness will prevail.</p><br><p><strong>Strengthening Faith</strong></p><br><p>Faith is fortified through diligent study, as Peter urged, “Pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place” (2 Peter 1:19), and through Christian association, “Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works” (Hebrews 10:25). In 537 BCE, Daniel’s unwavering trust, evidenced when “my God sent his angel” (Daniel 6:22) to protect him in the lions’ den, inspires modern worshipers. By immersing themselves in Jehovah’s Word and fellowship, they build the resilience to face persecution, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><strong>Trusting Jehovah</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers trust Jehovah’s protection, declaring, “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Jesus set the perfect example, proclaiming, “I have conquered the world!” (John 16:33), despite facing intense opposition. This trust prepares the faithful for the promised paradise, where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By remaining loyal under persecution, they demonstrate their devotion to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom, ready to inherit its eternal blessings.</p><br><p><em>“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” —Revelation 2:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Facing Ridicule</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to withstand ridicule, as forewarned: “They will speak abusively of you because they are bewildered by your good conduct” (1 Peter 4:4). Obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face mockery, just as Jesus endured: “Others he saved; himself he cannot save” (Matthew 27:42). Satan, “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), stirs scorn to weaken resolve, but Jehovah strengthens, saying, “Do not be afraid of them” (Matthew 10:28). Worshipers boldly declare, “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:20), preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>In 455 BCE, Nehemiah faced ridicule from enemies who “kept ridiculing us” (Nehemiah 4:1) while rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls, yet he persevered, trusting Jehovah. Today, faithful ones follow his example, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Give your servant strength” (Psalm 86:16), and focus on Scripture, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), assured that “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their steadfastness prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness reigns.</p><br><p><strong>Overcoming Mockery</strong></p><br><p>Overcoming ridicule requires boldness, as Paul stated, “I am not ashamed of the good news” (Romans 1:16), and humility, “Do nothing out of contentiousness or egotism” (Philippians 2:3). Around 2370 BCE, Noah, “a preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5), endured mockery while building the ark, yet his faith prevailed. Modern worshipers draw strength from such examples, maintaining their integrity and confidence that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), even when scorned for their faith.</p><br><p><strong>Maintaining Dignity</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers maintain dignity by responding with kindness, striving to “be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18), and emulating Jesus, who “when being insulted, he did not insult in return” (1 Peter 2:23). Their dignified conduct under ridicule reflects their trust in Jehovah’s promise of a future where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By staying focused on the Kingdom, they rise above mockery, prepared for Jehovah’s eternal blessings.</p><br><p><em>“We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” —Acts 4:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Resisting Family Opposition</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith enables worshipers to resist opposition from family, as Jesus warned: “A man’s enemies will be those of his own household” (Matthew 10:36). Despite such challenges, they fulfill Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus faced disbelief from His own brothers, who “were not exercising faith in him” (John 7:5), yet He prioritized God’s will. Satan seeks to divide families, as “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah unites His people, promising, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10).</p><br><p>In the 1st century, Timothy remained faithful despite family challenges, having “from infancy known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), guided by his mother and grandmother. Today, worshipers prioritize Jehovah, declaring, “Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35). They separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and pray, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10), trusting that “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their loyalty prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Balancing Loyalties</strong></p><br><p>Balancing family ties with devotion to Jehovah requires love, as commanded, “Honor your father and your mother” (Ephesians 6:2), and unwavering obedience to God, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). In 1711 BCE, Joseph resisted temptation, saying, “How could I commit this great evil and actually sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9), setting an example of loyalty. Worshipers today strive to maintain family respect while prioritizing Jehovah, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><strong>Showing Respect</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers show respect to family, ensuring “your speech be always gracious, seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6), and follow Jesus’ example, who said, “I have not come to destroy but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17). Their respectful conduct, even amidst opposition, reflects their faith in Jehovah’s promise of a future where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By staying loyal to Jehovah, they prepare for the blessings of His unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.” —Mark 3:35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Standing Firm in Trials</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to stand firm in trials, as Jesus assured: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Obeying the command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face challenges, just as Jesus “endured a torture stake” (Hebrews 12:2) for God’s will. Satan tests the faithful, as “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah strengthens, promising, “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Worshipers remain loyal, urged to “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>Around 1473 BCE, Job endured devastating loss, yet declared, “Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away” (Job 1:21), proving his faith. Today, faithful ones separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), and trust Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their endurance prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness will flourish.</p><br><p><strong>Building Endurance</strong></p><br><p>Endurance is built through persistent prayer, as urged, “Keep on praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and Christian association, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25). In the 1st century, Paul’s perseverance, declaring, “I have fought the fine fight” (2 Timothy 4:7), inspires worshipers to remain steadfast. By relying on Jehovah’s strength, they overcome trials, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the blessings of the unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><strong>Relying on Jehovah</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers rely on Jehovah, their “strength and fortress” (Psalm 18:2), following Jesus’ example, who prayed, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit” (Luke 23:46). Their trust in Jehovah’s guidance ensures they can face any trial, preparing for the promised paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By standing firm, they demonstrate their loyalty to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” —Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Overcoming Doubt</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith overcomes doubt, as affirmed: “This is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith” (1 John 5:4). While fulfilling Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), worshipers face uncertainty, yet Jesus reassured Thomas, “Stop being unbelieving, but become believing” (John 20:27). Satan sows doubt, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Worshipers strengthen their trust, urged to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and preach “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>In 1107 BCE, Gideon overcame doubt when reassured, “Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior” (Judges 6:12), leading him to victory. Today, faithful ones seek truth, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study diligently, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their conviction prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Strengthening Conviction</strong></p><br><p>Conviction grows through meditation, “I will meditate on all your activity” (Psalm 119:15), and prayer, “Open my eyes that I may see” (Psalm 119:18). In 33 CE, Peter’s recovery after denying Jesus, when tasked to “feed my lambs” (John 21:15), inspires worshipers to rebuild faith. By focusing on Jehovah’s promises, they overcome doubt, assured that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom’s blessings.</p><br><p><strong>Seeking Truth</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers seek truth by studying, “Search for it as for hidden treasures” (Proverbs 2:4), and following Jesus, who declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). Their pursuit of truth strengthens their faith, preparing them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By overcoming doubt, they align with Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“This is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith.” —1 John 5:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Rejecting Worldly Pressure</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to reject worldly pressure, as urged: “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2). While obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they resist temptation, just as Jesus rebuked, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). Satan tempts through “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Worshipers stand firm, urged to “flee from youthful desires” (2 Timothy 2:22), and preach “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>In 607 BCE, Daniel’s companions refused to bow to a golden image, declaring, “We will not serve your gods” (Daniel 3:18), trusting Jehovah’s deliverance. Today, faithful ones separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Do not let us yield to temptation” (Matthew 6:13), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their resistance prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Guarding the Mind</strong></p><br><p>Guarding the mind involves rejecting immorality, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and falsehood, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9). In 475 BCE, Esther’s courage, declaring, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16), to save her people, inspires worshipers to stand firm. By focusing on Jehovah’s standards, they maintain integrity, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the Kingdom’s blessings.</p><br><p><strong>Living for Jehovah</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers live for Jehovah, urged to “seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), following Jesus’ example, who said, “I do not seek my own will but the will of him who sent me” (John 5:30). Their commitment to Jehovah’s will prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By rejecting worldly pressure, they demonstrate loyalty to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be conformed to this system of things.” —Romans 12:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Maintaining Joy Amid Opposition</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith enables worshipers to maintain joy amid opposition, as urged: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials” (James 1:2). While obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face challenges, yet find joy, as Paul and Silas did in 50 CE, “praying and praising God with song” (Acts 16:25) in prison. Satan seeks to discourage, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah uplifts, declaring, “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold” (Nehemiah 8:10).</p><br><p>In 607 BCE, Habakkuk rejoiced despite hardship, proclaiming, “I will exult in Jehovah” (Habakkuk 3:18), trusting God’s salvation. Today, faithful ones find joy in separating from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Let my heart rejoice in your salvation” (Psalm 13:5), and trust Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their joy prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness prevails.</p><br><p><strong>Finding Joy</strong></p><br><p>Joy springs from faith, as “a joyful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22), and Christian association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). In 33 CE, the disciples “returned with great joy” (Luke 10:17) after preaching, inspiring worshipers to find happiness in service. By focusing on Jehovah’s promises, they maintain joy, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><strong>Sharing Joy</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers share joy by preaching, “Proclaiming the good news” (Acts 8:4), and encouraging others, “Speak consolingly to the depressed souls” (1 Thessalonians 5:14). Jesus prayed, “That my joy may be made full in them” (John 15:11), guiding worshipers to uplift others. Their joyful service prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials.” —James 1:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Proving Faithful Under Test</strong></p><br><p>Unshakable faith proves loyal under test, as Jesus promised: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). While fulfilling the command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), worshipers face trials, yet remain steadfast, as Peter did in 33 CE, declaring, “You are the Christ” (Matthew 16:16), despite pressure. Satan tests loyalty, as “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah rewards, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30).</p><br><p>In 1918 BCE, Abraham proved his faith, as “by faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac” (Hebrews 11:17), trusting Jehovah’s promise. Today, faithful ones demonstrate loyalty, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Do not let us yield to temptation” (Matthew 6:13), and remain “faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). Their steadfastness prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Proving Loyalty</strong></p><br><p>Loyalty requires obedience, as declared, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), and trust, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6). In 537 BCE, Daniel’s faith, shown by “he kept praying three times a day” (Daniel 6:10) despite a ban, inspires worshipers to remain loyal. By prioritizing Jehovah’s will, they ensure “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom’s blessings.</p><br><p><strong>Enduring Tests</strong></p><br><p>Worshipers endure tests by following Jesus’ example, who prayed, “Father, if you wish, remove this cup from me” (Luke 22:42), yet submitted to God’s will. They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), strengthening their resolve. Their faithfulness under test prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” —Revelation 2:10</em></p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p>Archaeological discoveries, such as ancient inscriptions bearing “YHWH,” alongside the unchanging truth of the Scriptures, powerfully vindicate Jehovah’s sacred name and His rightful sovereignty. Despite Satan’s relentless efforts to obscure the divine name through false religion and deceptive lies, faithful scribes, translators, and the New World Translation have restored “YHWH” to its rightful prominence. This enduring evidence urges all to reject Satan’s temporary world and embrace Jehovah’s eternal Kingdom, confidently trusting in His supreme rulership over all creation.</p><br><p><em>“Let them know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” —Psalm 83:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Universal Sovereignty</strong></p><br><p>The issue of universal sovereignty—Jehovah’s absolute right to rule as the Creator—lies at the heart of His name’s vindication, as declared: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Satan’s challenge in Eden and beyond questions Jehovah’s authority, but biblical truth and faithful examples demonstrate that His rulership is both just and loving, prevailing over all opposition.</p><br><p><strong>Satan’s Lie</strong></p><br><p>In the garden of Eden, Satan deceived Eve by suggesting that Jehovah’s rule was oppressive, withholding good from humans (Genesis 3:1-5). Later, he accused Jehovah of ruling unjustly, claiming that humans, like Job, serve Him only for selfish gain, not out of genuine love (Job 1:9-11). This lie portrays Jehovah as an unworthy sovereign, revealing Satan as “a liar and the father of the lie” (John 8:44). By challenging Jehovah’s right to rule, Satan seeks to undermine the loyalty of all intelligent creation.</p><br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Response</strong></p><br><p>Rather than destroying Satan immediately, Jehovah lovingly allows time to prove the devil’s accusations false, granting humans the freedom to choose whom they will serve (2 Peter 3:9). Faithful individuals, such as Job, who endured immense suffering yet declared, “May the name of Jehovah continue to be praised” (Job 1:21), demonstrate that humans can serve Jehovah out of love, not merely for blessings. Fulfilled prophecies, like the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE as foretold (Isaiah 46:10-11), further confirm Jehovah’s ability to guide history according to His purpose, proving His rulership is righteous and certain.</p><br><p><strong>Vindication Through the Kingdom</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s ultimate vindication comes through Christ’s Kingdom, established in the heavens in 1914, a year marked by global upheaval fulfilling signs like “nation against nation” (Daniel 2:44; Matthew 24:7). This Kingdom decisively casts out Satan’s influence, as “the ruler of this world will be cast out” (Revelation 12:10). Archaeological evidence, such as inscriptions bearing “YHWH,” and the faithful endurance of God’s servants reinforce the truth that “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5), affirming His sovereignty over all creation.</p><br><p><strong>Assurance for the Faithful</strong></p><br><p>The certainty of Jehovah’s vindication strengthens the faithful to reject Satan’s corrupt world, with its temporary pleasures and false promises. They trust in the unbreakable assurance that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44). By choosing to honor Jehovah’s name, the faithful align themselves with His eternal purpose, confidently awaiting the day when His sovereignty is universally acknowledged, fulfilling the prayer, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10).</p><br><p><em>“Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” —Revelation 12:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Moabite Stone: Earliest Inscription</strong></p><br><p>The Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele, provides the earliest extra-biblical evidence of Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” confirming its central role in true worship long before later attempts to obscure it, as declared: “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). This ancient artifact stands as a powerful witness to Jehovah’s prominence in Israel’s history.</p><br><p><strong>Moabite Stone (Mesha Stele)</strong></p><br><p>Discovered in 1868 at Dhiban, Jordan, this basalt stele was inscribed by King Mesha of Moab around 840 BCE, recounting his successful revolt against Israel, as recorded in Scripture (2 Kings 3:4-27). Line 18 explicitly mentions capturing “vessels of YHWH” from a sanctuary at Nebo, verifying that Jehovah’s name was integral to Israel’s worship practices. Housed in the Louvre Museum, Paris, with a replica in the British Museum, London, the stele’s authenticity is confirmed through radiocarbon dating and paleographic analysis, aligning it with the 9th century BCE. Its testimony, etched by an enemy king, underscores the undeniable prominence of “YHWH” in ancient Israel, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p><br><p><strong>Vindicating Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>The Moabite Stone’s reference to “YHWH,” carved by a rival ruler, directly counters Satan’s efforts to erase Jehovah’s name from human consciousness, as “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4). This artifact proves that Jehovah’s name was not only known but revered in Israel, even acknowledged by its enemies. By preserving this evidence, Jehovah ensures that His name remains a beacon of truth, resisting centuries of attempts by false religion to replace “YHWH” with generic titles like “Lord,” thus vindicating His identity as the one true God.</p><br><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” —Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Silver Scrolls and Lachish Letters</strong></p><br><p>Just before Babylon’s conquest of Judah, the Silver Scrolls and Lachish Letters preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” demonstrating its widespread use in daily life and worship, as urged: “Call on the name of Jehovah” (Joel 2:32). These artifacts provide tangible evidence of the name’s significance in Judahite society.</p><br><p><strong>Silver Scrolls (Kuntillet Ajrud)</strong></p><br><p>Unearthed in 1975 in southern Israel, these two tiny silver amulets, dated to around 600 BCE, are inscribed with blessings invoking “YHWH,” such as “May you be blessed by YHWH of Samaria and by His Asherah.” While the reference to Asherah reflects pagan influences, the use of “YHWH” confirms that Jehovah’s name was central to personal devotion among the Israelites. Displayed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, these scrolls, validated by archaeological analysis, highlight the name’s role in private worship, even in a time of spiritual decline.</p><br><p><strong>Lachish Letters</strong></p><br><p>Discovered in 1935 at the Lachish fortress, these ostraca (pottery shards) from around 590 BCE include military correspondence mentioning “YHWH,” such as “May YHWH cause my lord to hear tidings of peace today.” Written just before Jerusalem’s fall, they show that Jehovah’s name was used in everyday communication among Judah’s leaders. Preserved in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, these letters affirm the name’s integration into both religious and secular life, resisting efforts to diminish its prominence.</p><br><p><strong>Enduring Evidence</strong></p><br><p>Validated by rigorous archaeological methods, including paleography and contextual analysis, the Silver Scrolls and Lachish Letters prove that “YHWH” was a familiar and cherished name across all levels of Judahite society. Their survival counters later attempts by false religion to replace Jehovah’s name with titles like “Lord,” ensuring that “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). These artifacts stand as a testament to Jehovah’s promise that His name would remain known, strengthening the faithful to proclaim it boldly in the face of opposition.</p><br><p><em>“My people will know my name.” —Isaiah 52:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls: Preserving YHWH</strong></p><br><p>During the Second Temple period, when Hellenistic culture threatened true worship, the Dead Sea Scrolls preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” with remarkable care, demonstrating the devotion of faithful scribes amid a world under Satan’s influence, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19).</p><br><p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls</strong></p><br><p>Discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, these 900+ manuscripts, dated from 200 BCE to 70 CE, include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a), one of the most complete, prominently uses “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” This deliberate use of an archaic script underscores the name’s sanctity, distinguishing it from other terms. Housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Museum, Amman, the scrolls, dated through carbon-14 and paleographic analysis, were likely preserved by the Essenes, a Jewish sect dedicated to scriptural purity. Their work ensured that Jehovah’s name remained intact, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p><br><p><strong>Resisting Paganism</strong></p><br><p>The Dead Sea Scrolls’ meticulous preservation of “YHWH” stood firm against the encroaching influence of Greek philosophy and pagan practices, which sought to dilute true worship. By safeguarding the Hebrew Scriptures, these faithful scribes ensured that Jehovah’s name and His promises would not be forgotten, as “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11). This enduring testimony counters Satan’s efforts to obscure the divine name, providing a foundation for later restorations, such as the New World Translation, which relies on these pure texts to proclaim Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p><br><p><em>“This is my name forever.” —Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Septuagint Fragments: Retaining the Name</strong></p><br><p>In the face of Hellenistic pressures, early Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures, known as the Septuagint, retained Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” resisting the trend to replace it with generic titles, thus upholding the truth that “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p><br><p><strong>Septuagint Fragments</strong></p><br><p>Papyrus Fouad 266, a 2nd-century BCE manuscript found in Egypt, preserves “YHWH” in Hebrew characters within Greek text, notably in passages like Deuteronomy 32:8-9, rather than substituting “Kyrios” (Lord), as later copies did. Stored in the Cairo Museum, this fragment, dated through paleographic analysis, reflects the reverence of Jewish scholars in Alexandria for Jehovah’s name. These translators, working around 280–150 BCE, ensured that Greek-speaking Jews in the diaspora could honor the divine name, countering the influence of pagan philosophies that sought to diminish its significance.</p><br><p><strong>Preserving Sanctity</strong></p><br><p>By retaining “YHWH” in its original Hebrew form, these Septuagint fragments preserved the sanctity of Jehovah’s name, fulfilling the declaration, “Let them know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Their survival provides critical evidence that early Jewish communities resisted Hellenistic attempts to erase the divine name, laying a foundation for later efforts to restore it, such as in the New World Translation. This steadfast commitment ensures that Jehovah’s identity remains clear, even amidst Satan’s efforts to obscure it through false worship.</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” —Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Codices: Sinaiticus and Vaticanus</strong></p><br><p>As apostate Christianity grew in the 4th century, early Christian codices, such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, preserved traces of Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” despite the increasing substitution of “Kyrios” (Lord), fulfilling the promise that “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). These manuscripts played a vital role in safeguarding the Scriptures during a time of spiritual corruption, though they faced challenges that required later correction.</p><br><p><strong>Codex Sinaiticus</strong></p><br><p>Compiled around 350 CE, this is one of the earliest complete Greek Bibles, discovered at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now housed in the British Library, London. It occasionally retains “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotations, particularly in passages like Psalm 83:18, showing that some scribes recognized the name’s importance. However, its inconsistent use of “YHWH” and inclusion of uninspired texts, such as the Apocrypha (e.g., Tobit), reflect the influence of apostate trends that sought to dilute true worship. The codex’s preservation of early Christian Scriptures, dated through paleographic analysis and radiocarbon testing, provided a critical link to the original texts, despite these flaws.</p><br><p><strong>Codex Vaticanus</strong></p><br><p>Also dated to around 350 CE, this Greek manuscript, stored in the Vatican Library, Rome, preserves Old Testament texts where “YHWH” appeared in the Hebrew originals, though it typically uses “Kyrios” due to prevailing Jewish and Christian traditions avoiding the divine name. Like Sinaiticus, it includes uninspired Apocryphal books and lacks certain passages, such as Mark 16:9-20, indicating textual variations. Its survival, validated by archaeological methods, ensured that traces of Jehovah’s name endured, even as false religion sought to obscure it.</p><br><p><strong>Faithful Preservation</strong></p><br><p>Despite their flaws, such as inconsistent use of “YHWH” and the inclusion of uninspired texts, Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were monumental in preserving the Scriptures during a period of widespread apostasy, ensuring that “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). Faithful scribes, under pressure from doctrinal disputes and Roman persecution, maintained the core of God’s Word, providing a foundation for later translations like the New World Translation, which corrected these errors by restoring “YHWH” consistently. These codices stand as a testament to Jehovah’s ability to safeguard His truth, even through imperfect human efforts, countering Satan’s attempts to suppress His name.</p><br><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” —Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Masoretic Texts: Aleppo and Leningrad Codices</strong></p><br><p>In the Middle Ages, Jewish scribes known as Masoretes meticulously preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” in the Hebrew Scriptures, countering efforts by false religion to remove it, as Satan, “the dragon, was enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17). Their work ensured that Jehovah’s name remained clear and accessible for future generations.</p><br><p><strong>Aleppo Codex (C. 930 CE)</strong></p><br><p>Crafted in Tiberias, this Masoretic Hebrew Bible is one of the most authoritative texts of the Hebrew Scriptures, containing “YHWH” 6,973 times, with vowel points indicating the pronunciation “Jehovah.” Housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, the codex, dated through paleographic analysis, reflects the Masoretes’ rigorous methods, such as counting letters and verses to ensure accuracy. Its preservation of “YHWH” in every instance where it appeared in the original texts provided a reliable source for later translations, resisting centuries of attempts to replace the divine name with titles.</p><br><p><strong>Leningrad Codex (C. 1008 CE)</strong></p><br><p>The oldest complete Hebrew Bible, this manuscript, located in the National Library of Russia, St. Petersburg, also includes “YHWH” 6,973 times, with precise vowel points for “Jehovah.” Copied in Cairo, it aligns closely with the Aleppo Codex, confirming the Masoretes’ unparalleled accuracy. Its detailed annotations, or Masorah, safeguarded the text against errors, ensuring that Jehovah’s name and His Word remained pure, as “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). The Leningrad Codex serves as a primary source for modern translations, including the New World Translation.</p><br><p><strong>Masoretic Fidelity</strong></p><br><p>The Masoretes’ commitment to preserving “YHWH” with vowel points clarified its pronunciation as “Jehovah,” directly fulfilling the declaration, “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Unlike earlier codices that sometimes used “Kyrios” or included uninspired texts, the Masoretic texts are remarkably free of significant flaws, offering a pure transmission of the Hebrew Scriptures. Their work countered Satan’s efforts to obscure Jehovah’s name through false religion, providing a solid foundation for the New World Translation to restore “YHWH” accurately and consistently, ensuring that Jehovah’s identity is proclaimed worldwide.</p><br><p><em>“My people will know my name.” —Isaiah 52:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Modern Restoration: Tyndale to New World Translation</strong></p><br><p>From the Reformation to the 20th century, faithful servants courageously restored Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” overcoming Satan’s lies and the suppression of false religion, fulfilling the promise, “I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on the name of Jehovah” (Zephaniah 3:9). Their efforts, culminating in the New World Translation, decisively vindicated Jehovah’s name, though earlier attempts faced significant challenges.</p><br><p><strong>William Tyndale (1530)</strong></p><br><p>Tyndale’s groundbreaking translation of the Pentateuch into English boldly used “Jehovah” in key passages, such as Exodus 6:3, defying Catholic bans on vernacular Bibles. Facing persecution, he was strangled and burned at the stake in 1536, yet his work, preserved in the British Library, London, influenced later translations like the King James Version. Tyndale’s limited use of “Jehovah” and reliance on incomplete manuscripts, such as the Latin Vulgate, restricted his impact, but his courage laid a foundation for restoring the divine name, aligning with “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p><br><p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1612)</strong></p><br><p>Ainsworth, a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his annotations on the Psalms, notably citing Psalm 83:18 to emphasize its importance. His work, preserved in the British Library, helped spread awareness of the divine name among English-speaking believers. However, his focus on annotations rather than a full translation and the prevailing use of “Lord” in other Bibles limited his influence, necessitating further restoration efforts to counter the widespread suppression of “YHWH.”</p><br><p><strong>New World Translation (1950–1961)</strong></p><br><p>The New World Translation, released in stages and revised in 2013, restored “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 instances in the Hebrew Scriptures and 264 in the Christian Scriptures, based on early manuscripts like the Leningrad Codex and Papyrus Fouad 266. With over 240 million copies printed in more than 200 languages, it decisively counters the substitution of “Lord” in earlier translations, such as the King James Version, which used “Jehovah” only four times. By relying on the oldest texts and excluding uninspired additions, the NWT ensures that “the word of God is alive and exerts power” (Hebrews 4:12), providing an accurate and unbiased representation of Jehovah’s name and His truth.</p><br><p><strong>Global Proclamation</strong></p><br><p>Supported by archaeological discoveries like the Moabite Stone and Dead Sea Scrolls, the efforts of Tyndale, Ainsworth, and the New World Translation have ensured that “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). While Tyndale and Ainsworth faced persecution and limited manuscript access, the NWT overcame these challenges through scholarly rigor and global distribution, equipping Jehovah’s Witnesses to proclaim His name in 240 lands, even amidst opposition like Russia’s 2017 ban. This modern restoration decisively vindicates Jehovah’s name, countering centuries of Satan’s lies and fulfilling the call, “You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah (Isaiah 43:10).</p><br><p><em>“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. —Isaiah 43:10</em></p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p>From the corruption of apostasy to the restoration of pure worship, faithful servants of Jehovah have courageously battled to uphold divine truth against Satan’s deceptive lies. Throughout history, these individuals resisted false teachings and preserved the integrity of Jehovah’s Word, ensuring that pure worship endured despite relentless opposition. Their efforts reflect the enduring power of truth, as foretold in scripture, and demonstrate Jehovah’s guidance in restoring his worship to its rightful purity.</p><br><p><em>“I did not hold back from preaching to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house.” —Acts 20:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>False Worship Rises: Gnosticism and Ignatius</strong></p><br><p>Following the death of the apostles, false worship began to infiltrate Christianity, fulfilling the warning that “savage wolves” would emerge to distort the truth (Acts 20:29). Satan, described as “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), cunningly blended pagan practices with Christian teachings, obscuring the pure worship of Jehovah. This period marked a significant departure from the apostolic teachings, as false doctrines gained traction among early Christians.</p><br><p>Gnosticism, a prominent heresy, denied Jehovah’s sovereignty by promoting mystical and pagan beliefs, including Babylonian star worship, which directly contradicted the declaration that “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). Gnostic teachings, which emphasized secret knowledge and dualistic philosophies, led many astray from the simplicity of scriptural truth. Historical records, such as those from early Christian writers like Irenaeus, confirm Gnosticism’s widespread influence, with sects like the Valentinians adapting pagan myths into Christian frameworks, further muddying pure worship.</p><br><p>Ignatius of Antioch, who died around 110 CE, contributed to this apostasy by introducing a clergy-laity distinction, claiming bishops held superior authority. This defied Jesus’ teaching that “you are all brothers” (Matthew 23:8). Ignatius’ letters, preserved in collections like the <em>Ante-Nicene Fathers</em>, promoted unscriptural hierarchies reminiscent of Babylonian priestly systems, establishing a foundation for later ecclesiastical power structures. His teachings marked a significant shift from the egalitarian worship practiced by early Christians.</p><br><p>Amid this growing apostasy, Polycarp, a disciple of the apostle John, stood firm. He rejected pagan festivals like Saturnalia, which celebrated the Roman god Saturn and conflicted with Christian principles. Before his martyrdom in 155 CE, Polycarp boldly declared, “I am a Christian,” affirming his loyalty to Jehovah. His courage, documented in the <em>Martyrdom of Polycarp</em>, preserved the foundation of true worship, aligning with the promise that “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Archaeological evidence, such as early Christian inscriptions in Smyrna, supports the historical context of Polycarp’s stand against pagan influences.</p><br><p><strong>Faithful Stand</strong></p><br><p>Polycarp’s unwavering courage thwarted Satan’s schemes, ensuring that the spark of true worship remained alive. His example fulfilled the assurance that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), inspiring future generations to resist false teachings. His stand underscores the enduring power of Jehovah’s truth against overwhelming opposition.</p><br><p><em>“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” —Revelation 2:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Nicene Corruption: Constantine’s Trinity</strong></p><br><p>The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE represented the pinnacle of apostasy, as foretold in the description of “Babylon the Great” corrupting true worship (Revelation 17:5). Under Emperor Constantine, paganism was systematically merged with Christianity, obscuring Jehovah’s name and distorting core biblical teachings. This council marked a turning point, institutionalizing false doctrines that would dominate for centuries.</p><br><p>Constantine, who ruled from 272 to 337 CE, convened the Council of Nicaea to unify the Roman Empire’s religious factions. He adopted the Trinity doctrine, a concept rooted in Babylonian triadic deities, using the term “homoousios” to assert that Jesus was equal to God. This contradicted the clear scriptural statement, “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5). Constantine’s Edict of Milan in 313 CE had already legitimized Christianity, but it also promoted pagan festivals like Christmas, which derived from the birthday of the sun god Mithra (Jeremiah 10:2). Historical records, such as Eusebius’ <em>Life of Constantine</em>, confirm Constantine’s blending of pagan and Christian practices to consolidate political power.</p><br><p>Arius, a presbyter from Alexandria (256–336 CE), boldly opposed the Trinity, upholding the scriptural truth that Jesus is “the firstborn of creation” (Colossians 1:15). His teachings, which emphasized Jehovah’s unique sovereignty, were condemned at Nicaea, leading to his exile. Despite facing the threat of death, Arius’ stand preserved a spark of truth, fulfilling the promise that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Surviving fragments of Arius’ writings, such as his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, corroborate his commitment to monotheism, aligning with biblical principles.</p><br><p><strong>Resisting Apostasy</strong></p><br><p>Arius’ courage ensured that Jehovah’s truth endured, countering Constantine’s decrees and preserving the declaration, “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). His resistance laid a foundation for later reformers to challenge the entrenched errors of the Trinity and pagan influences.</p><br><p><em>“This is my name forever.” —Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jerome Preserves Scripture</strong></p><br><p>As Catholic apostasy intensified, blending paganism with Christianity, the faithful scribe Jerome played a pivotal role in preserving Jehovah’s Word. His efforts countered the influence of “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), ensuring that scripture remained accessible despite Satan’s attempts to obscure it. Jerome’s work fulfilled the assurance that “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p><br><p>Commissioned by Pope Damasus, Jerome completed the Latin Vulgate translation by 405 CE, relying on Hebrew and Greek manuscripts that included the divine name “YHWH.” Unlike the Trinitarian errors promoted at Nicaea, Jerome’s meticulous scholarship preserved the integrity of the scriptures. He consulted original texts, such as the Hebrew Masoretic manuscripts, to retain Jehovah’s name and uphold biblical laws. The Vulgate, preserved in institutions like the Bodleian Library in Oxford, became a vital resource for scholars, enabling future restorers of pure worship. This aligns with the promise that “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). Archaeological discoveries, such as the Codex Sinaiticus, confirm the accuracy of early manuscripts used by Jerome, supporting his commitment to scriptural fidelity.</p><br><p><strong>Enduring Truth</strong></p><br><p>Though later misused by a corrupt church, Jerome’s Vulgate safeguarded Jehovah’s Word, complementing subsequent efforts to restore pure worship. His translation ensured that the scriptures remained a beacon of truth, as Jesus declared, “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p><br><p><em>“My words will not pass away.” —Matthew 24:35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Waldensians: Defying Catholic Bans</strong></p><br><p>The Waldensians, led by Peter Waldo, courageously battled Catholic suppression to preserve Jehovah’s Word, fulfilling the prophecy that “the dragon was enraged” with those upholding truth (Revelation 12:17). Their efforts to make scripture accessible to the common people challenged the Catholic Church’s monopoly on religious knowledge.</p><br><p>Defying Catholic bans on vernacular translations, the Waldensians produced Bible translations in languages like Provençal, making God’s Word available to the poor. Branded as heretics, they hid manuscripts in the Alps to protect them from destruction. Their work countered papal indulgences and pagan rituals, such as the veneration of relics, which lacked scriptural basis. By sharing truth with humility, the Waldensians fulfilled the command to “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Historical accounts, such as those in the <em>Cambridge Medieval History</em>, document their widespread influence, with Waldensian communities persisting despite brutal persecution.</p><br><p><strong>Preserving Truth</strong></p><br><p>The Waldensians’ sacrifices ensured the survival of Jehovah’s Word, laying critical groundwork for the Reformation. Their efforts reflect the enduring promise that “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8), guiding future generations toward pure worship.</p><br><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot.” —Psalm 119:105</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Reformation Martyrs: Wycliffe, Hus, Tyndale</strong></p><br><p>During the Reformation, courageous translators like John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, and William Tyndale risked their lives to restore access to Jehovah’s Word, breaking the chains of Catholic suppression. Their efforts fulfilled the prophecy that “those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16), spreading truth despite fierce opposition.</p><br><p>John Wycliffe (1328–1384) produced the first complete English Bible in 1382, translated from Jerome’s Vulgate, defying Catholic bans on vernacular scriptures. Declared a heretic, his bones were exhumed and burned posthumously, yet his translations inspired widespread reform. Wycliffe’s work, preserved in manuscripts like the Wycliffe Bible at Oxford, aligned with the declaration that “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><br><p>Jan Hus (1369–1415), a Bohemian reformer, rejected unscriptural practices like indulgences, preaching the Bible’s authority. Burned at the stake in 1415, his writings influenced Martin Luther and the broader Reformation. Hus’ trial records, archived in Prague, confirm his unwavering commitment to scriptural truth, fulfilling the promise that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p><br><p>William Tyndale (1494–1536) advanced the cause by translating the Pentateuch and using “Jehovah” in texts like Exodus 6:3, defying Catholic prohibitions. Strangled and burned in 1536, Tyndale’s translations shaped the King James Version, spreading Jehovah’s name as urged in “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Surviving copies of Tyndale’s New Testament, such as those in the British Library, attest to his meticulous scholarship.</p><br><p><strong>Sacrifices for Truth</strong></p><br><p>These martyrs’ sacrifices dismantled apostate barriers, restoring access to Jehovah’s Word and paving the way for further restoration of pure worship.</p><br><p><em>“Your word is truth.” —John 17:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Restorers: Ainsworth, Grew, Storrs</strong></p><br><p>Before the emergence of the Bible Students, individuals like Henry Ainsworth, Henry Grew, and George Storrs rejected false doctrines, laying essential groundwork for the restoration of pure worship. Their efforts fulfilled the promise that “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9), clearing the way for truth to prevail.</p><br><p>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622), a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his 1612 annotations on the Psalms, notably Psalm 83:18, countering Trinitarian errors. Exiled for his beliefs, his work, preserved in rare books like those at the University of Amsterdam, promoted the proclamation of God’s name, as urged in “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p><br><p>Henry Grew (1781–1862) rejected the Trinity and the hellfire doctrine, teaching the importance of Jehovah’s name. His pamphlets, which circulated widely in the 19th century, influenced Charles Taze Russell and aligned with the scriptural truth that “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Grew’s writings, archived in theological libraries, reflect his commitment to biblical accuracy.</p><br><p>George Storrs (1796–1879) taught the hope of an earthly resurrection in his <em>Six Sermons</em>, rejecting the immortal soul doctrine. His teachings, which reached thousands through publications, aligned with the promise that “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). Storrs’ influence is documented in 19th-century religious journals, highlighting his role in restoring scriptural hope.</p><br><p><strong>Clearing Apostate Debris</strong></p><br><p>These restorers’ diligent efforts removed layers of apostate teachings, preparing the way for the full restoration of pure worship in the modern era.</p><br><p><em>“My people will know my name.” —Isaiah 52:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Russell’s Foundation: Bible Students</strong></p><br><p>Charles Taze Russell spearheaded a pivotal movement to restore pure worship, rejecting the false doctrines of mainstream religion. His work fulfilled the prophecy that “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), laying a foundation for the modern restoration of Jehovah’s truth.</p><br><p>Influenced by Henry Grew and George Storrs, Russell rejected the Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul doctrines. In 1870, he formed a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, which grew into a global movement. Launching <em>Zion’s Watch Tower</em> in 1879 and founding the Watch Tower Society in 1884, Russell calculated 1914 as the year of Christ’s enthronement, based on Daniel 4:25. This prediction was strikingly confirmed by the outbreak of World War I, aligning with signs of “nation against nation” (Matthew 24:7). Despite persecution, Russell’s efforts restored scriptural truth, fulfilling Jehovah’s call, “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). Historical records, such as early Watch Tower publications preserved in the Watchtower Archives, document Russell’s extensive preaching campaigns, which reached millions.</p><br><p><strong>Restoring Truth</strong></p><br><p>Russell’s foundational work established the Bible Students, later known as Jehovah’s Witnesses, as a beacon of truth, countering centuries of apostasy and advancing the global preaching of God’s Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Declare his glory among the nations.” —1 Chronicles 16:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Modern Restoration: Rutherford, Knorr, Witnesses</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses have fully restored pure worship, preaching God’s Kingdom message worldwide, fulfilling the prophecy that “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). Through courageous leadership and unwavering dedication, they have overcome opposition to spread scriptural truth.</p><br><p>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869–1942), succeeding Russell in 1917, faced intense persecution, including imprisonment in 1918 for publishing biblical truth. His legal victories, including 43 Supreme Court cases, secured the right to preach, as documented in U.S. legal archives. In 1931, Rutherford named the group Jehovah’s Witnesses, based on Isaiah 43:10, and utilized radio broadcasts to “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1), reaching millions globally.</p><br><p>Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977), leading from 1942, oversaw the release of the New World Translation (1950–1961), which restored Jehovah’s name and corrected apostate substitutions like “Lord.” By founding the Gilead School in 1943, Knorr trained missionaries who spread truth to 240 lands, fulfilling the declaration that “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). The translation’s accuracy is supported by comparisons with ancient manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which confirm the frequent use of “YHWH” in Hebrew texts.</p><br><p>Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses, numbering approximately 9 million, have logged 1.5 billion hours preaching in 2024, despite bans, such as Russia’s 2017 prohibition, which was condemned by international human rights organizations. Their global mission upholds Jehovah’s truth, as promised in “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23). Statistical reports from the 2024 Service Year confirm their extensive outreach, with a peak membership of around 9 million and 7.5 million Bible studies conducted, demonstrating the fulfillment of the global preaching work.</p><br><p><strong>Pure Worship Restored</strong></p><br><p>Through the tireless efforts of Rutherford, Knorr, and millions of Witnesses, pure worship has been fully restored, ensuring that Jehovah’s name and truth shine brightly across the earth.</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” —Psalm 37:29</em></p>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p>The Bible reveals God’s impartial love for all races, ethnicities, and cultures, uniting humanity under His purpose for everlasting life.</p><br><p><em>“God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” —Acts 10:34, 35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Creation of All Humanity: One Origin</strong></p><br><p>From the beginning, God created all humanity from one man, Adam, showing His approval of all races and ethnicities as one family. Genesis 1:26, 27 states, “Let us make man in our image,” and “male and female he created them,” with no distinction of race or culture. Acts 17:26 reinforces this: “He made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth.” This unity in creation, dated to the beginning of human history in biblical chronology, establishes God’s impartiality toward all peoples.</p><br><p>The diversity of languages and cultures arose later at Babel (Genesis 11:9), but God’s purpose remained for all to seek Him (Acts 17:27). Unlike ancient myths that divided humanity by divine favoritism, such as the Babylonian Enuma Elish favoring certain tribes, the Bible affirms equal value for all, fulfilling “God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good” (Genesis 1:31).</p><br><p><em>“God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.” —Genesis 1:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Abraham’s Blessing for All Nations: A Universal Promise</strong></p><br><p>God’s covenant with Abraham, dated around 1943 BCE through biblical chronology, extended His approval to all nations. Genesis 12:3 declares, “By means of you all the families of the earth will be blessed.” This promise, reiterated to Isaac and Jacob (Genesis 26:4; 28:14), shows God’s purpose to include every race and ethnicity in His blessings, transcending cultural boundaries.</p><br><p>Abraham’s interactions with foreigners, like the Hittites (Genesis 23:3-4), were marked by respect, reflecting God’s impartiality. This contrasts with ancient practices, such as Egypt’s exclusion of foreigners in sacred rites (as seen in the Papyrus of Ani, circa 1250 BCE). God’s promise, fulfilled through Jesus (Galatians 3:16), underscores His love for all, fulfilling “I will bless those who bless you” (Genesis 12:3).</p><br><p><em>“I will bless those who bless you.” —Genesis 12:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Israel’s Law and Foreigners: Equal Treatment</strong></p><br><p>God’s Law given to Israel through Moses around 1513 BCE included provisions for foreigners, showing His approval of all ethnicities. Leviticus 19:34 commands, “The foreigner residing among you should become to you like a native among you; and you must love him as yourself.” Numbers 15:15 adds, “The same regulation will apply to you and to the foreign resident.” These laws ensured equal justice and worship opportunities for non-Israelites, such as the Egyptians who joined the Exodus (Exodus 12:38).</p><br><p>Historical records, like the Amarna Letters (circa 1350 BCE), show other nations often oppressed foreigners, but God’s Law promoted inclusion, as seen in Rahab the Canaanite’s acceptance (Joshua 6:25). This divine standard reflects God’s impartiality, fulfilling “You must love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18).</p><br><p><em>“You must love your neighbor as yourself.” —Leviticus 19:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Prophetic Inclusion of All Nations: A Future Hope</strong></p><br><p>God’s prophets, writing between the 8th and 5th centuries BCE, foretold a time when all nations would worship Him, showing His approval of every race and culture. Isaiah 2:2, 3 (circa 740 BCE) prophesies, “In the final part of the days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will become firmly established, and all the nations will stream to it.” Zechariah 8:23 (circa 520 BCE) adds, “Ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’”</p><br><p>These prophecies contrast with other ancient texts, like the Assyrian Annals (circa 700 BCE), which boast of racial supremacy. God’s vision, preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE), included foreigners like the Ethiopian eunuch (Isaiah 56:3-5), fulfilling “My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples” (Isaiah 56:7).</p><br><p><em>“My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.” —Isaiah 56:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jesus’ Ministry to All Peoples: Breaking Barriers</strong></p><br><p>Jesus’ ministry from 29 to 33 CE, as recorded in the Gospels, demonstrated God’s approval of all nationalities by breaking cultural barriers. John 4:9-10 recounts Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, a group despised by Jews, offering her “living water.” Matthew 15:21-28 shows Him healing the daughter of a Canaanite woman, praising her faith despite her ethnicity. Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37) further taught love across racial divides.</p><br><p>Unlike the Roman society of the time, which segregated based on ethnicity (e.g., Roman citizenship laws excluding many), Jesus’ actions fulfilled God’s impartiality, as seen in His command: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19). Early manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve these accounts, affirming “God so loved the world” (John 3:16).</p><br><p><em>“God so loved the world.” —John 3:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Early Christian Expansion: Unity in Diversity</strong></p><br><p>The early Christian congregation, from 33 to 100 CE, exemplified God’s approval of all peoples as the good news spread to diverse nations. Acts 2:5-11 describes the Pentecost miracle, where Jews and proselytes from Parthia, Media, Egypt, and Rome heard the message in their own languages. Acts 10:34-35 recounts Peter’s realization after meeting Cornelius, a Roman centurion: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.”</p><br><p>Paul’s missionary journeys reached Greeks, Romans, and Asians (Acts 19:10), uniting them in worship, as seen in Galatians 3:28: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor freeman, male nor female, for you are all one in union with Christ Jesus.” This unity, preserved in early manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE), contrasts with the Roman Empire’s ethnic hierarchies, fulfilling “Look! A great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” (Revelation 7:9).</p><br><p><em>“Look! A great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” —Revelation 7:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Modern Implications of Impartiality: Overcoming Division</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s teachings on impartiality continue to guide true worshipers today, encouraging them to overcome racial and cultural divisions. Revelation 7:9-10’s vision of “a great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” inspires Christians to reject xenophobia and embrace unity. The Bible, available in numerous languages since early translations like the Septuagint (circa 280 BCE), ensures all can access God’s Word, reflecting His desire for global worship.</p><br><p>Unlike historical movements that promoted racial division, such as apartheid in South Africa (1948–1994), the Bible’s principles promote love across cultures, as seen in early Christian communities where Jews and Gentiles worshiped together (Ephesians 2:14). This timeless standard aligns with God’s purpose, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord.” —Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Unity Under God’s Kingdom: No Xenophobia</strong></p><br><p>God’s Kingdom will fully eliminate xenophobia, uniting all races and cultures in perfect harmony, as foretold in scripture. Psalm 22:27 promises, “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him.” Revelation 21:3-4 describes a future where “God’s tent is with mankind,” and “death will be no more,” with no racial or cultural divisions, only peace for “every nation and tribe and tongue.”</p><br><p>Unlike human governments that perpetuate division, as seen in modern conflicts like ethnic cleansing in Rwanda (1994), God’s Kingdom will ensure equality, as “the Lord will be King over all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9). This hope, rooted in God’s impartial love, fulfills “They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain” (Isaiah 11:9), uniting all humanity forever.</p><br><p><em>“They will not cause any harm or any ruin.” —Isaiah 11:9</em></p>

        <p><strong>Faithful Youth</strong></p><br><p>Youths who serve Jehovah shine as “lights in the world” (Philippians 2:15), choosing faithfulness over worldly desires, “Flee from youthful desires” (2 Timothy 2:22). Timothy, a young disciple in 50 CE, was commended, “Let no one look down on your youth” (1 Timothy 4:12), for his zeal. Satan tempts with immorality, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah strengthens, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). Youths stand firm, “Be wise, my son” (Proverbs 27:11), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Like Daniel, who “refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8) in 617 BCE, faithful youths resist compromise, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), and rely on Jehovah, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Their example inspires, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), as they align with Jehovah’s purpose, “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Choosing Faith</strong></p><br><p>Youths choose Jehovah over peer pressure, “Do not follow after the crowd” (Exodus 23:2), and immorality, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18). Joseph’s stand, “How could I commit this great evil?” (Genesis 39:9), around 1711 BCE, guides them. They pray, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><strong>Shining as Examples</strong></p><br><p>Youths shine by preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living purely, “Be an example in conduct” (1 Timothy 4:12). They follow Jesus’ youth, “He grew in wisdom” (Luke 2:52), and trust, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6), preparing for “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p><em>“Let no one look down on your youth.” —1 Timothy 4:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Resisting Peer Pressure</strong></p><br><p>Peer pressure tempts youths to conform, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), but Jehovah’s standards protect, “Guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). In 607 BCE, Daniel’s companions resisted idolatry, “We will not serve your gods” (Daniel 3:18), showing courage. Satan pushes compromise, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah empowers, “I will make you firm” (Isaiah 41:10). Youths resist, “Be wise, my son” (Proverbs 27:11), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Like Esther, who stood firm in 475 BCE, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16), youths reject worldly ways, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They seek godly friends, “He who walks with wise people will become wise” (Proverbs 13:20), and pray, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13). Their stand ensures “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Identifying Pressures</strong></p><br><p>Pressures include immorality, “The works of the flesh are evident” (Galatians 5:19), and rebellion, “Do not follow after the crowd” (Exodus 23:2). Youths recognize Satan’s tactics, “He deceives those dwelling on the earth” (Revelation 13:14), and study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><strong>Building Courage</strong></p><br><p>Youths build courage through prayer, “Give your servant courage” (Psalm 86:16), and association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). Jesus’ resolve, “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33), inspires them. Their strength prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p><em>“Do not be conformed to this system of things.” —Romans 12:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pursuing Spiritual Goals</strong></p><br><p>Youths pursue spiritual goals, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), over worldly ambitions, “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things” (1 Timothy 6:10). Timothy, in 50 CE, served zealously, “From infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15). Satan distracts with materialism, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Youths preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and study, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p><br><p>Like Samuel, who served from childhood, “Samuel kept growing with Jehovah” (1 Samuel 2:21), around 1100 BCE, youths prioritize worship, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They set goals like preaching or baptism, “Be doers of the word” (James 1:22), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><strong>Setting Godly Goals</strong></p><br><p>Goals include regular study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and ministry, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). David’s aim, “I will praise Jehovah at all times” (Psalm 34:1), inspires youths. They plan, “The plans of the diligent lead to success” (Proverbs 21:5), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p><br><p><strong>Achieving Spiritual Success</strong></p><br><p>Youths achieve success through effort, “Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might” (Ecclesiastes 9:10), and prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Jesus’ focus, “I must do the works of him who sent me” (John 9:4), guides them. Their goals prepare for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p><br><p><em>“Seek first the Kingdom.” —Matthew 6:33</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Maintaining Moral Purity</strong></p><br><p>Moral purity protects youths, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), in a world of corruption, “The works of the flesh are evident” (Galatians 5:19).
