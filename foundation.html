                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s name stands as the most significant and sacred identifier in all of Scripture, appearing over 7,000 times in the original Hebrew and Greek texts, a frequency that highlights its unparalleled importance to true worship and understanding the Creator. This divine name, represented by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH), translates to “He Causes to Become,” a meaning that encapsulates Jehovah’s role as the purposeful and dynamic Creator who brings His will into reality. The Bible emphatically states, “I am Jehovah; that is my name; I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to carved images” (Isaiah 42:8), making it clear that Jehovah alone is worthy of exclusive devotion and that He refuses to share His unique identity with any false god or idol. This name was first revealed to Moses around 1513 BCE at the burning bush, a dramatic encounter where Jehovah declared, “This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation” (Exodus 3:15). That revelation was not just a label but a promise tied to His eternal purpose—to transform the earth into a paradise populated by perfect humans, as He originally commanded Adam and Eve, saying, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28). Jesus, Jehovah’s obedient Son, reinforced the sanctity of this name by teaching his followers to pray, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified” (Matthew 6:9), and by affirming, “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them” (John 17:26). These statements underscore that knowing and honoring Jehovah’s name is not optional but essential to having a genuine relationship with Him and receiving His blessings.</p>
                        <p>Despite its importance, Satan, the great enemy of Jehovah, has waged a relentless campaign to erase this name from human awareness, a battle that traces back to Nimrod’s rebellion at Babel around 2269 BCE. At that time, rebellious humans gathered to build a tower and declared, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4), an act of defiance against Jehovah’s authority that sought to elevate human pride over divine rule. This event set the stage for Satan’s ongoing efforts to obscure Jehovah’s identity, a strategy that gained traction centuries later when Jewish scribes, around 300 BCE, began avoiding pronouncing the divine name out of superstition, substituting it with titles like “Adonai” (Lord). This practice carried over into many Bible translations, where “LORD” in all capital letters replaced Jehovah’s name, a move that dilutes His personal identity and fosters confusion about who the true God is. Yet, Jehovah’s mighty acts throughout history shout His name louder than any human effort can silence it. For instance, around 1473 BCE, He parted the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and then drowned Pharaoh’s pursuing army, as “the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen” (Exodus 14:27-28), proving that no power can stand against the One whose name is above all. Similarly, when Jehovah brought down the walls of Jericho around the same period, “the wall fell flat” (Joshua 6:20) at His command, a physical demonstration of His sovereignty that echoes the declaration, “Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God and the King forever” (Jeremiah 10:10). These events serve as undeniable evidence that Jehovah’s name represents His active presence and unmatched power in the universe.</p>
                        <h2>Historical Suppression</h2>
                        <p>The suppression of Jehovah’s name didn’t stop with ancient superstitions; it intensified as false religion grew in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly by the third century CE, when apostate Christians began adopting pagan practices and titles that further distanced them from the true God. During this period, the influence of Greek philosophy and Roman traditions crept into the emerging church, leading to a deliberate effort to replace Jehovah’s name with generic terms like “God” or “Lord,” a shift that aligned with the blending of Christian teachings with pagan beliefs. However, Jehovah promised that this erasure would not last forever, as He foretold through the prophet Isaiah, “My people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that I am the one speaking—here I am” (Isaiah 52:6). This prophecy is being fulfilled today as the truth about His name is restored, supported by historical evidence such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 but dated to around 200 BCE, which contain numerous instances of the Tetragrammaton in its original Hebrew form. These ancient manuscripts refute claims that Jehovah’s name is irrelevant or outdated, proving that it was cherished and used by His faithful servants long before false traditions took hold. Moreover, archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone, from around 840 BCE, mention “YHWH,” further confirming that Jehovah’s name was known and revered in ancient times, even among neighboring nations. This historical record stands as a testament to Jehovah’s enduring identity and His determination to be known by His people, just as He promised, “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12).</p>
                        <h2>Fate vs. Free Will</h2>
                        <p>One of Satan’s most insidious lies, propagated through ancient Babylonian astrology around 2000 BCE, is the concept of fate—an unchangeable destiny that strips humans of choice and accountability, locking them into a predetermined path they cannot escape. This belief, which spread through cultures like the Babylonians and later the Greeks, suggested that the stars or gods dictated every event, leaving no room for personal decision or divine mercy. In stark contrast, Jehovah’s Word dismantles this falsehood by affirming the gift of free will, as He told the Israelites, “See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and bad... therefore choose life so that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). This command makes it clear that humans are not puppets controlled by fate but beings created with the ability to choose their course, a freedom that reflects Jehovah’s justice and love. A powerful example of this principle is seen in His dealings with Nineveh around 830 BCE, when He sent Jonah to warn that wicked city of impending destruction, saying, “Only forty days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). Yet, when the Ninevites repented, “God saw their works—that they had turned back from their evil ways—and he felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on them, and he did not bring it” (Jonah 3:10). This dramatic turnaround proves that Jehovah responds to human choices, not a fixed destiny, and that He delights in mercy when people turn to Him, as He says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked one should turn back from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Thus, the lie of fate is exposed as a tool of Satan to rob humans of hope, while Jehovah’s truth offers freedom and life through the exercise of free will in harmony with His will.</p>
                        <h2>Satan’s Lies</h2>
                        <p>Satan, “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), began deceiving humanity in Eden with “You positively will not die” (Genesis 3:4), a falsehood that birthed every distortion of Jehovah’s truth, blinding billions, for “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). After the apostles’ death, he infiltrated the Christian congregation, as Paul warned, “Savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock” (Acts 20:29-30), twisting pure worship into a mix of paganism and lies by the second century CE. His deceptions—holidays like Christmas, doctrines like hellfire, and theories like evolution—enslave minds, as “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4). Jehovah exposed this when He struck Ananias and Sapphira dead for lying, “You have lied, not to men, but to God” (Acts 5:4-5), showing His hatred for falsehood.</p>
                        <p>From Babel’s tower around 2269 BCE, where “Jehovah scattered them” (Genesis 11:9), to Rome’s pagan revival under Julian in 361 CE, Satan has opposed Jehovah’s purpose, yet his lies crumble under scrutiny. Evolution lacks fossils of transitional forms—apes to humans remain unproven—and no science validates an afterlife, only “dust you are and to dust you will return” (Genesis 3:19). Jehovah’s truth prevails, as “you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), and His judgment looms, for “the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:10).</p>

            <!-- Creation Section -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Creation</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah is the supreme Creator of all things, and He brought the universe into existence through His firstborn Son, Jesus, whom the Bible describes as “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15) and “the beginning of the creation by God” (Revelation 3:14). This act of creation unfolded over six creative days, not literal 24-hour periods but vast epochs during which Jehovah prepared the earth step-by-step for human habitation, culminating in His command to Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28). The Bible opens with the majestic declaration, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), a statement that establishes Jehovah as the sole source of all life and matter, a truth echoed by the psalmist who marveled, “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24). Scientific evidence supports this divine act, such as the sudden appearance of complex life forms during the Cambrian Explosion around 540 million years ago, a geological event where fully formed creatures like trilobites emerged without any evolutionary precursors, contradicting the gradual development claimed by Darwin’s theory. Furthermore, the human genome, with its 3 billion base pairs of DNA in each cell, stands as a masterpiece of design, a molecular code so intricate that it defies the notion of random chance, pointing instead to a purposeful intelligence behind it—Jehovah, who “stretched out the heavens by himself” (Isaiah 44:24).</p>
                        <p>The earth itself bears witness to Jehovah’s thoughtful creation, designed with precision to sustain life in ways that random processes could never achieve. Its 23.5-degree axial tilt ensures the seasons, allowing crops to grow and ecosystems to thrive, while its magnetic field shields it from deadly solar radiation, and its water cycle provides the fresh water essential for all living things. As the Bible states, “He did not create it simply for nothing, but he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18), a purpose that evolution cannot explain. Satan, however, has promoted the lie of evolution to blind humanity to Jehovah’s handiwork, claiming life arose by chance over millions of years. Yet, the fossil record lacks transitional forms—there are no half-fish, half-reptile creatures or other “missing links” to bridge species, a gap that evolutionists struggle to fill. Even radiometric dating, often cited to support an ancient earth, falters under scrutiny; for example, volcanic rocks formed at Mount St. Helens in 1980 were tested and dated as millions of years old, exposing the method’s unreliability. Jehovah’s creation stands firm against such falsehoods, as He declares, “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; the skies above proclaim the work of his hands” (Psalm 19:1), inviting all to see His wisdom in the world around them.</p>
                        <h2>The Flood</h2>
                        <p>Around 2370 BCE, Jehovah executed a global flood that reshaped the earth and wiped out a corrupt, violent civilization, an event He announced to Noah with the words, “I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which there is the breath of life” (Genesis 6:17). This was no mere local deluge but a cataclysmic judgment that spared only Noah, his family, and representatives of every animal kind, preserved in an ark that Jehovah instructed Noah to build, saying, “Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood” (Genesis 6:14). The ark, measuring 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high (Genesis 6:15)—approximately 450 feet by 75 feet by 45 feet—was a marvel of divine engineering, its dimensions aligning with the stability ratios of modern ships, ensuring it could withstand the raging waters. Evidence of this flood abounds in the geological record, such as the Karoo Formation in South Africa, which contains an estimated 800 billion vertebrate fossils buried in vast sedimentary layers, a testament to rapid, catastrophic burial rather than slow accumulation over eons. Similarly, coal seams and oil deposits worldwide, formed from massive amounts of organic material, point to a sudden, global upheaval consistent with the Bible’s account. Flood legends from cultures like the Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, dated to around 2000 BCE, and the Chinese tale of Nuwa, echo this event, preserving a collective memory of Jehovah’s judgment, which He promised never to repeat, saying, “Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood” (Genesis 9:11).</p>
                        <h2>Animal Creation</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah created animals “according to their kinds” (Genesis 1:25), a process that produced distinct categories of life—birds, fish, mammals, and more—each perfectly suited to its environment and role in the earth’s ecosystem. This biblical truth stands in sharp contrast to evolution’s claim that all life evolved from a single ancestor, a theory that requires countless intermediate forms that simply do not exist in the fossil record. Consider the complexity of animal features like the eagle’s eye, with its ability to spot prey from miles away, or the bat’s echolocation, a sonar system so precise it detects insects in mid-flight—these are examples of irreducible complexity, meaning they require all parts to function and could not have developed gradually. Jehovah’s care for His creation is evident in His words, “Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them” (Matthew 6:26), and “Not one sparrow is forgotten in God’s sight” (Luke 12:6), showing that He sustains even the smallest creatures. Scientific studies, such as those on the bombardier beetle, which fires a boiling chemical spray to deter predators, reveal systems so intricate that they defy step-by-step evolution, pointing instead to a deliberate act of creation by Jehovah, who “made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds” (Genesis 1:25) in a display of wisdom and power that continues to amaze those who study His works.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">True Worship</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>True worship is the heartfelt, obedient service that Jehovah, the only true God, demands from those who seek everlasting life, a principle Jesus made clear when he said, “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ” (John 17:3). This worship is not a casual or optional act but a way of life defined by doing Jehovah’s will, as Jesus warned, “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will” (Matthew 7:21). Jehovah has always required exclusive devotion, commanding, “You must not have any other gods besides me” (Exodus 20:3), a standard so serious that He struck Uzzah dead for irreverently touching the ark (2 Samuel 6:7), showing that true worship must be pure and respectful. His worshipers are united as “one flock with one shepherd” (John 10:16), bound by “one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5), and they fulfill the global commission to preach, as Jesus foretold, “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14). From the first century to today, this unity and mission have defined Jehovah’s people, setting them apart from the divided, ritualistic religions of the world.</p>
                        <p>The history of true worship is marked by perseverance through persecution, a test that has refined and strengthened Jehovah’s servants across the ages. In 64 CE, the Roman Emperor Nero falsely blamed Christians for the great fire of Rome, subjecting them to horrific tortures—some were sewn into animal skins and torn apart by dogs, others were burned alive as human torches—yet their faith endured, as “they went away from the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored for the sake of that name” (Acts 5:41). This scattering only spread the good news further, fulfilling the pattern seen when “a great persecution arose against the congregation in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria” (Acts 8:1-4). Today, true worshipers continue this legacy by remaining “no part of the world” (John 17:16), refusing to participate in politics, wars, or nationalistic fervor, a stand that mirrors Daniel’s refusal to bow to King Darius’ image around 539 BCE, when he chose the lions’ den over compromise (Daniel 6:10-16). Jehovah honors such loyalty, promising, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), and He expects His worshipers to reflect His holiness, as Jesus taught, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), a call to worship that is active, informed, and unwavering.</p>
                        <h2>Good News</h2>
                        <p>The good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom is the central message of true worship, a promise of a real government that will soon transform the earth into a paradise, as foretold in the prophecy, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom, led by Jesus Christ, offers hope for a world free of suffering, where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29), and it fulfills Jehovah’s original purpose for humanity, which He expressed in Eden. Jesus taught his followers to pray for this solution, saying, “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth” (Matthew 6:10), a prayer that has been answered in part since 1914, when Christ began ruling, and will be fully realized when “a new heavens and a new earth” emerge (2 Peter 3:13). This message has been preached since Jesus’ day, when he “went through the cities and villages, teaching and continuing his journey, proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God” (Luke 8:1), and it continues today through a global effort that reaches billions, proving that Jehovah’s worshipers are not passive but active heralds of His coming reign, as He commands, “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19).</p>
                        <h2>Baptism</h2>
                        <p>Baptism is a sacred, public declaration of dedication to Jehovah, a step that every true worshiper must take to symbolize their commitment to His service, as Jesus instructed, “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit” (Matthew 28:19). This is not a ritual for infants, as some false religions practice, but a conscious choice made by adults who understand its meaning, following the example of Jesus, who was baptized at about 30 years old, when “the heavens were opened up to him” (Matthew 3:16-17; Luke 3:23). The act represents a request to God for a clean conscience, as Peter explained, “Baptism, which corresponds to this, is now saving you (not by the removal of the filth of the flesh, but by the request made to God for a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 3:21). This practice dates back to the first century, when thousands were baptized after hearing the truth, such as the 3,000 on Pentecost who “were baptized and added on that day” (Acts 2:41), but it stands in contrast to the pagan-influenced infant baptisms introduced by Christendom in the fourth century CE, a tradition with no scriptural basis. Jehovah views baptism as a serious vow, and He expects those who take it to live up to it, as “the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p>
                        <h2>Neutrality</h2>
                        <p>True worshipers maintain strict neutrality in the world’s conflicts, a principle rooted in Jesus’ declaration, “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought” (John 18:36), which sets them apart from the political and military entanglements that dominate human society. In the first century, early Christians faced death rather than serve in Rome’s armies or honor its emperors as gods, a stand that led to martyrdom in arenas where “they overcame because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing” (Revelation 12:11). This neutrality reflects Jehovah’s own impartiality, as He says, “I am Jehovah, who exercises loyal love, justice, and righteousness in the earth” (Jeremiah 9:24), and it aligns with His command to “love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you” (Matthew 5:44), rather than taking sides in human disputes. Today, this stance is evident when true worshipers refuse to salute flags, vote in elections, or fight in wars, choices that often bring persecution but fulfill the call to be “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), separate from Satan’s system, which “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). Jehovah promises protection to those who remain faithful, as He did for Daniel in the lions’ den (Daniel 6:22), ensuring that “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">False Worship</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>False worship is Satan’s counterfeit system that opposes Jehovah’s truth, described in the Bible as “Babylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth” (Revelation 17:5), a vast network of religions that deceive humanity and provoke Jehovah’s wrath. This rebellion began at Babel around 2269 BCE, when Nimrod led humanity to defy Jehovah, saying, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens” (Genesis 11:4), an act that prompted Jehovah to confuse their languages and scatter them, declaring, “Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth” (Genesis 11:9). Jehovah hates false worship with a fierce jealousy, as He warns, “I will remove those turning away from following Jehovah and those who do not seek Jehovah or inquire of him” (Zephaniah 1:6), and He demonstrated this by incinerating Nadab and Abihu with fire from heaven when they offered “unauthorized fire” before Him (Leviticus 10:1-2). The end of this system is certain, as Revelation proclaims, “Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons” (Revelation 18:2), a judgment that will destroy all who cling to her lies, for Jehovah commands, “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins” (Revelation 18:4).</p>
                        <p>From Nimrod’s pagan towers to the ornate churches of today, false worship has blended truth with lies, enslaving billions under Satan’s influence, as Jesus described the religious leaders of his day, “You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father” (John 8:44). This deception spans history, from the ziggurats of Mesopotamia to the cathedrals of Christendom, all marked by idolatry and doctrines that defy Jehovah’s Word. For example, Jehovah struck down 3,000 Israelites for worshiping the golden calf around 1513 BCE, declaring, “Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me!” (Exodus 32:26-28), a swift punishment that shows His intolerance for mixing His worship with paganism. Today, false religion continues to thrive on holidays, clergy hierarchies, and rituals that have no basis in Scripture, but Jehovah’s judgment looms, as He promises, “In one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God who judged her is strong” (Revelation 18:8). True worshipers must flee this corrupt system, heeding the call to “worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters” (Revelation 14:7).</p>
                        <h2>Christmas</h2>
                        <p>The celebration of Christmas, widely accepted as a Christian holiday, actually originates from pagan festivals like Rome’s Saturnalia, a week-long revelry of feasting and gift-giving that began around 217 BCE, and the worship of Mithra, a Persian god whose birth was celebrated on December 25. The Bible provides no command to celebrate Jesus’ birth, and the account of his nativity notes that “shepherds were living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks” (Luke 2:8), a detail suggesting an autumn birth, likely in September or October, when shepherds in Judea still tended flocks outdoors, not a winter date like December 25. This pagan origin was cemented in 336 CE, when Emperor Constantine, seeking to unify his empire’s Christians and pagans, officially merged these traditions into a “Christian” holiday, a move that Scripture never endorses. Jehovah forbids adopting such customs, warning, “Do not learn the way of the nations... for the customs of the peoples are a delusion” (Jeremiah 10:2-3), yet Christmas persists with its trees, lights, and Santa Claus—elements rooted in Germanic and Norse mythology, not the Bible. True worshipers reject this festival, knowing that Jehovah demands worship “in truth” (John 4:24), not through lies borrowed from idolaters.</p>
                        <h2>Easter</h2>
                        <p>Easter, another cornerstone of false worship, fuses the commemoration of Jesus’ resurrection with pagan fertility rites, a blend that traces back to the Anglo-Saxon goddess Eostre, documented in the eighth century CE by the historian Bede, whose symbols of rabbits and eggs celebrated spring and renewal. The Bible records Jesus’ death on Nisan 14, the Passover date, when he said, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), a command tied to a simple memorial, not a festival with bunnies and baskets. His resurrection occurred three days later, but Scripture never links it to pagan symbols or mandates an annual celebration; rather, his sacrifice was “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), not a recurring ritual. Jehovah rejected such mixtures in Israel’s history, as when He plagued the nation for worshiping a golden calf, a fertility symbol, and “about 3,000 men of the people fell on that day” (Exodus 32:28, 35). Easter’s traditions mock the purity of Jesus’ ransom, and Jehovah’s view is clear: “I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies” (Amos 5:21), a condemnation that applies to all who blend His truth with pagan lies.</p>
                        <h2>Clergy</h2>
                        <p>The clergy-laity distinction, a hallmark of false religion, emerged in Christendom by the third century CE, mimicking the hierarchical priesthoods of pagan Rome and Babylon, where exalted leaders lorded over the masses. Jesus explicitly rejected such titles and divisions, teaching his disciples, “You are all brothers... do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One” (Matthew 23:8-10), a command that levels all true worshipers as equals before Jehovah. Yet, false religion elevates men with titles like “Reverend,” “Father,” or “Pope,” a practice that echoes the Babylonian priests who claimed divine authority over their followers. Jehovah’s arrangement is different: He calls all His servants “a royal priesthood” (1 Peter 2:9), meaning every true worshiper has direct access to Him through Jesus, as “there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). When Korah rebelled against Moses’ leadership around 1473 BCE, claiming undue authority, Jehovah opened the earth to swallow him and his followers (Numbers 16:31-33), a stark warning against usurping His structure. The clergy system defies this, but true worshipers humbly serve as equals, reflecting Jehovah’s will that “the flock of God” be shepherded “not under compulsion, but willingly” (1 Peter 5:2).</p>
                        <h2>The Trinity</h2>
                        <p>The Trinity doctrine, which claims that God exists as three co-equal, co-eternal persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is a man-made fabrication that contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture and finds its roots in paganism, not Jehovah’s truth. This belief was formalized at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, under the influence of Emperor Constantine, who sought to unify his empire’s fractured religious factions, but it mirrors earlier triads from Babylon, Egypt, and India, such as the Babylonian trio of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, dating back to around 2000 BCE. The Bible, however, presents Jehovah as the sole God, declaring, “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4), and “Before me no God was formed, and after me there has been none” (Isaiah 43:10), leaving no room for a three-in-one deity. Jesus himself affirmed this hierarchy, saying, “The Father is greater than I am” (John 14:28), and after his resurrection, he called Jehovah “my God and your God” (John 20:17), showing he is subordinate, not co-equal. No original Bible text supports the Trinity; the spurious addition in some versions of 1 John 5:7—“the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one”—is a later forgery, absent from manuscripts before the 14th century, as scholars like Sir Isaac Newton recognized when exposing its corruption.</p>
                        <p>Constantine’s political agenda drove the Trinity’s adoption, blending Christian terms with pagan concepts to appease both groups, but this compromise dishonors Jehovah, who demands worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Jesus is not Jehovah but “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15), created by God as the “beginning of the creation by God” (Revelation 3:14), through whom “all other things were created” (Colossians 1:16). Their relationship is one of unity in purpose, not identity, as Jesus prayed, “That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you” (John 17:21), a harmony shared with his followers, not a mystical three-in-one essence. Jehovah’s supremacy is absolute, as He says, “I am Jehovah, and there is no other; there is no God except me” (Isaiah 45:5), while Jesus serves as “one mediator between God and men” (1 Timothy 2:5), a role that requires distinction, not equality. True worshipers reject the Trinity, honoring Jehovah alone as the Almighty, just as the psalmist sang, “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth” (Psalm 83:18).</p>
                        <h2>Holy Spirit</h2>
                        <p>The holy spirit is not a person or part of a Trinity but Jehovah’s active force, the invisible power He uses to accomplish His will, as seen when “God’s spirit moved over the surface of the waters” during creation (Genesis 1:2). This force empowered Bezalel to craft the tabernacle, for “I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding and knowledge” (Exodus 31:3), and it inspired the prophets, as “men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit” (2 Peter 1:21). Unlike Jehovah and Jesus, who are persons with names and identities, the holy spirit is never named, greeted, or depicted as speaking independently in Scripture, showing it is a tool, not a being. Jesus described it as a helper, saying, “The helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things” (John 14:26), but this reflects its function, not a personality. Pagan triads like Egypt’s Osiris, Isis, and Horus influenced the idea of a spirit-person, but Jehovah’s Word clarifies that His spirit “searches all things, even the deep things of God” (1 Corinthians 2:10), acting as His instrument, not a co-equal deity. True worshipers recognize this distinction, giving glory to Jehovah alone, as “every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the Father” (James 1:17).</p>
                        <h2>Spiritism</h2>
                        <p>Spiritism, the practice of contacting the dead or unseen forces, is a demonic deception that Jehovah forbids, commanding, “There should not be found in you anyone who... consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller, or anyone who inquires of the dead” (Deuteronomy 18:10-11). When King Saul sought a medium at En-dor around 1070 BCE, “Jehovah put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David” (1 Chronicles 10:13-14), a judgment showing that such acts provoke His anger, for “those practicing spiritism are detestable to Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 18:12). Practices like astrology, born in Babylon around 2000 BCE, Halloween, from the Celtic Samhain around 1000 BCE, and modern Ouija boards, patented in 1890, exploit Satan’s lie that the dead live on, yet Scripture declares, “The dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Science supports this—brain death ends consciousness, as “his spirit goes out, he returns to the ground” (Psalm 146:4)—proving spiritism is a fraud, “a lie that comes from the demons” (1 Timothy 4:1).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s view is uncompromising: when Israel adopted Canaanite necromancy, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (2 Kings 17:17-18), leading to exile. Satan uses spiritism to “blind the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), as when the girl with “a spirit of divination” harassed Paul until he expelled it (Acts 16:16-18). True worshipers shun these, trusting “the God of the living” (Matthew 22:32), not the dead, for “Jehovah is near to all those calling on him” (Psalm 145:18), needing no intermediaries from the grave.</p>
                        <h2>Reincarnation</h2>
                        <p>Reincarnation, taught in Hinduism around 1200 BCE, claims souls cycle through endless lives, a lie that contradicts Jehovah’s promise of resurrection, for “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Acts 24:15). Job rejected this, saying, “I will wait until my relief comes” (Job 14:14), awaiting one restoration, not repetition. Jehovah created man to live once, as “it is reserved for men to die once for all time” (Hebrews 9:27), and His plan is “to bring all things together again in the Christ” (Ephesians 1:10), not scatter them in cycles. When He destroyed false worshipers at Baal-Peor, “24,000 fell” (Numbers 25:9), not reborn, proving death ends life until resurrection. True hope lies in “the God who gives life to the dead” (Romans 4:17), not in Satan’s endless wheel.</p>
                        <h2>Pagan Practices</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah explicitly forbids pagan practices, commanding, “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below” (Exodus 20:4), a law He enforced with severe judgment when the Israelites defied Him. Around 1513 BCE, when they worshiped a golden calf, “Jehovah struck the people with a plague” and 3,000 died by the sword (Exodus 32:28, 35), showing His hatred for idolatry that mimics Egypt’s bull cults from 3000 BCE. Later, around 920 BCE, King Ahab’s Baal worship provoked Jehovah to send a three-year drought, as Elijah declared, “There will be no dew or rain during these years except by my word” (1 Kings 17:1), a punishment that devastated Israel until they repented. Today, pagan symbols like crosses—derived from the Egyptian ankh, a life symbol from 3000 BCE—and statues of saints pervade false religion, but Jehovah’s stance remains: “I am Jehovah your God, a God who requires exclusive devotion” (Exodus 20:5). Jesus died on a simple stake, not a cross, as “he was nailed to the torture stake” (Acts 2:23), a fact obscured when Constantine adopted the cross in 312 CE to merge Christianity with paganism.</p>
                        <p>These practices thrive on idolatry, a rebellion Jehovah has always crushed, as when He destroyed Jeroboam’s altar for false worship, “the altar was ripped apart and the ashes spilled out” (1 Kings 13:5). From Babylon’s star worship to Rome’s emperor cults, paganism infects modern religion with rituals that dishonor Jehovah, who warns, “Guard yourselves from idols” (1 John 5:21). True worshipers reject these, knowing that “friendship with the world is enmity with God” (James 4:4), and they heed Jehovah’s call to “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), avoiding the contamination of Satan’s counterfeit worship that “blinds the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4).</p>
                        <h2>Birthdays</h2>
                        <p>Birthday celebrations, rooted in Egyptian and Greek astrology from around 2000 BCE, exalt the individual rather than Jehovah, a focus Scripture never endorses. The Bible records only pagans celebrating birthdays—Pharaoh, who “made a feast for all his servants” and executed his baker (Genesis 40:20-22), and Herod, whose party led to John the Baptist’s beheading (Matthew 14:6-10)—while Jehovah’s servants, like Job or Jesus, never marked such days. These events tied birthdays to superstition, as Egyptians believed a person’s spirit was vulnerable on their birth date, a belief foreign to Jehovah’s worship, which centers on Him, as “every day is alike” for the righteous (Romans 14:5). Jehovah’s view is clear: “Do not turn to worthless gods” (Leviticus 19:4), and birthdays, with their cakes, candles, and wishes, echo pagan rites that He rejects, for “the sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to Jehovah” (Proverbs 15:8).</p>
                        <h2>Saint Worship</h2>
                        <p>Prayers to saints, a staple of false religion, mirror Rome’s emperor worship from 27 BCE and Ephesus’ devotion to Artemis, where “the temple keeper of the great Artemis” stirred a riot against Paul (Acts 19:27-35). Jesus taught, “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5), yet false worshipers pray to Mary or Peter, defying Jehovah’s command, “You must not make for yourself a carved image” (Exodus 20:4). When Israel turned to Baal-Peor, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel” and 24,000 died (Numbers 25:3-5), a warning against venerating any but Him. Statues and relics of saints, like Rome’s Pantheon repurposed for “saints” in 609 CE, are idolatry, and Jehovah declares, “My glory I will not give to another” (Isaiah 48:11), ensuring that true worshipers pray only “to the Father” (Matthew 6:6).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">The Kingdom</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is the divine government that will soon end all human rule and restore the earth to its intended paradise, a promise fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who began ruling as King in 1914, as foretold, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom’s establishment was marked by “the appointed times of the nations” ending (Luke 21:24), calculated from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE through Daniel’s “seven times” (Daniel 4:25)—2,520 years that pinpoint 1914, when wars, famines, and earthquakes surged, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation... there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7-8). Jehovah’s purpose is unshakable, as He declares, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring that this Kingdom will “fill the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35). It comprises 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:1, 3), while a “great crowd” survives Armageddon to inhabit the earth (Revelation 7:9), a dual hope that reflects Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p>
                        <p>Human governments, from Rome’s collapse in 476 CE to today’s nations, have failed to bring peace, but Jehovah’s Kingdom succeeds where they falter, as “your throne, O God, is forever and ever” (Psalm 45:6). Its signs since 1914—global conflicts like World War I, pandemics like the Spanish Flu—confirm its presence, and Jesus’ parable of the wheat and weeds shows it grows amid opposition until “the harvest,” when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:39-43). Jehovah’s past interventions, like toppling Babylon in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), preview this Kingdom’s triumph, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). True worshipers pray for its full realization, knowing “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p>
                        <h2>Armageddon</h2>
                        <p>Armageddon is Jehovah’s final war against wickedness, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), a climactic event that follows “the great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning” (Matthew 24:21). It will destroy false religion—“Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2)—and evil governments, as “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). Jehovah’s power was shown when He drowned Egypt’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), and Armageddon will be even greater, for “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). Survivors will inherit a cleansed earth, where “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p>
                        <h2>1914</h2>
                        <p>The year 1914 marks a pivotal moment in Bible prophecy, when Jesus Christ was enthroned as King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, ending “the appointed times of the nations” (Luke 21:24), a period of Gentile domination that began with Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon in 607 BCE. This date is calculated from Daniel’s prophecy of “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), where Nebuchadnezzar’s seven-year madness symbolized 2,520 years (using “a day for a year” from Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6), stretching from 607 BCE to October 1914. That year saw the outbreak of World War I, an unprecedented conflict that killed millions, alongside famines and the 1918 Spanish Flu, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7). Jehovah’s purpose advanced, as “the Son of man came on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:30), not visibly but in authority, a reign confirmed by “your throne is established from long ago” (Psalm 93:2).</p>
                        <p>In 1914, Satan was cast out of heaven, intensifying earth’s woes, as “the dragon was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him... woe to the earth and to the sea” (Revelation 12:9, 12). This expulsion triggered “the last days” (2 Timothy 3:1), a time of moral decay and global upheaval that matches prophecy, for “all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress” (Matthew 24:8). Jehovah’s Kingdom began cleansing the heavens, preparing for its earthly rule, as “he must rule as king until he has put all enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25). True worshipers recognized this shift, intensifying their preaching, for “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), a work that has since reached every corner of the globe.</p>
                        <h2>Prophetic Evidence</h2>
                        <p>Daniel’s vision of a statue—gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay (Daniel 2:31-44)—traced world powers from Babylon to Rome, ending with a divided modern era struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom in 1914, for “it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Ezekiel’s prophecy, “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it... until he comes whose right it is” (Ezekiel 21:27), pointed to Christ’s enthronement, confirmed by history—1914’s war shattered empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary, signaling the old order’s collapse. Jehovah’s Word proves true, as “not one word of all his good promise failed” (1 Kings 8:56), and 1914 stands as a beacon of His timetable, urging all to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19).</p>
                        <h2>Prophecy</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophecies are infallible, proving His sovereignty over time and history, as “not one of all the good promises Jehovah made to the house of Israel failed; all of them came true” (Joshua 21:45). Daniel foresaw world powers—Babylon’s gold, Persia’s silver, Greece’s bronze, Rome’s iron, and today’s divided feet of iron and clay (Daniel 2:32-43)—culminating in 1914, when “the stone cut out of the mountain” struck, God’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44). Isaiah named Cyrus 200 years before his birth, “saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd’” (Isaiah 44:28), fulfilled when he conquered Babylon in 539 BCE, freeing Israel, as “the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). Tyre’s ruin, “I will make you a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), came true when Alexander the Great scraped it clean in 332 BCE, showing “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s foreknowledge sets Him apart, as “I am God, and there is no other... declaring the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:9-10). He foretold Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), and its 70-year captivity, “until the land had paid off its sabbaths” (2 Chronicles 36:21), precisely fulfilled by Cyrus’ decree. These proofs silence doubters, for “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35), urging all to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19).</p>
                        <h2>Last Days</h2>
                        <p>The “last days” began in 1914, marked by “critical times hard to deal with” (2 Timothy 3:1), as Jesus predicted, “You will hear of wars and reports of wars... nation will rise against nation” (Matthew 24:6-7), fulfilled by World War I and beyond. Greed, immorality, and “lovers of themselves” (2 Timothy 3:2) dominate, mirroring Noah’s day, when “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11), prompting Jehovah’s flood. Today’s preaching, “this good news will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), signals “the end will come,” a warning Jehovah echoes, “The great day of Jehovah is near” (Zephaniah 1:14), urging all to “seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6).</p>

            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Memorial</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Memorial is the annual observance of Jesus’ death, held on Nisan 14, the Jewish Passover date, when he instituted it, saying, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), a command that honors his sacrifice as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). That night in 33 CE, Jesus took bread and wine, declaring, “This means my body... this cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood” (1 Corinthians 11:24-25), symbols of his perfect life given as “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). This event fulfills the Passover, when Jehovah spared Israel’s firstborn as “the destroyer passed over” (Exodus 12:13), a shadow of Christ’s greater deliverance, for “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7). Only the 144,000 anointed ones partake of the emblems, as “they will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6), while others observe, reflecting on “the precious blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:19).</p>
                        <p>False religion distorts this into weekly masses or Easter feasts, but Jesus’ death was “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), not a repeated ritual, as “he entered once for all into the holy place... with his own blood” (Hebrews 9:12). Jehovah views the Memorial as sacred, a time to “proclaim the death of the Lord until he arrives” (1 Corinthians 11:26), not to be tainted by paganism, for “what fellowship does light have with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14). When Israel profaned His worship, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Numbers 25:3), and today, true worshipers keep it pure, honoring “the Son of man who gave his life” (Mark 10:45).</p>
                        <h2>Significance</h2>
                        <p>The Memorial’s significance lies in its sealing of the new covenant, which Jesus announced, “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf” (Luke 22:20), a pact that offers forgiveness and life, for “without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22). It opens the way to Jehovah, as “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), a spiritual partaking for the anointed and a reminder for all of “the love the Christ has” (Ephesians 3:19). Jehovah’s purpose shines through, as “he bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24), ensuring “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9).</p>
                        <h2>Jesus’ Role</h2>
                        <p>Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s “faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14), the central figure in His purpose, created as “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15) and “the beginning of the creation by God” (Revelation 3:14), through whom “all other things were created” (Colossians 1:16). He declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6), serving as the only path to Jehovah, a role cemented by his ransom, for “through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). Jehovah exalted him, as “God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name” (Philippians 2:9), ensuring “every knee should bend” (Philippians 2:10). His life on earth, teaching “the good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 4:23), and his death on the stake, “he bore our sins” (1 Peter 2:24), fulfilled Jehovah’s will, earning him the right to rule, for “he must rule as king until he has put all enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s voice affirmed Jesus at his baptism, “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved” (Matthew 3:17), and again at the transfiguration, “Listen to him” (Matthew 17:5), showing his unique Sonship, not equality with God. He resisted Satan’s temptations, saying, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship” (Matthew 4:10), and died faithfully, crying, “It has been accomplished!” (John 19:30). Jehovah resurrected him, “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20), entrusting him with “all authority in heaven and on earth” (Matthew 28:18), a role he fulfills since 1914, preparing to “judge the living and the dead” (2 Timothy 4:1).</p>
                        <h2>Mediator</h2>
                        <p>As “one mediator between God and men” (1 Timothy 2:5), Jesus bridges humanity to Jehovah, a role vital since Adam’s sin severed that bond, for “through one man sin entered into the world” (Romans 5:12). He prayed, “I make request... that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me” (John 17:20-21), uniting his followers with God through his blood, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2). Jehovah accepts this mediation, as “there is no salvation in anyone else” (Acts 4:12), and Jesus intercedes, “he is able to save completely those who are approaching God through him” (Hebrews 7:25), a privilege for all who “call on the name of Jehovah” (Romans 10:13).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Family</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah instituted marriage as a sacred union, declaring, “A man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24), a bond Jesus upheld, saying, “What God has yoked together, let no man put apart” (Matthew 19:6). This arrangement, established in Eden around 4026 BCE, reflects Jehovah’s purpose for companionship and procreation, as “God blessed them and said to them, ‘Be fruitful and become many’” (Genesis 1:28). Families are the foundation of worship, tasked to “train up a boy according to the way for him” (Proverbs 22:6), ensuring “the knowledge of God” fills the earth (Habakkuk 2:14). When David sinned with Bathsheba around 1000 BCE, “the thing David had done was very displeasing to Jehovah” (2 Samuel 11:27), and the child died as punishment (2 Samuel 12:14), showing that Jehovah views violations of this union—adultery, divorce for trivial reasons—as serious sins, for “I hate divorce,” says Jehovah (Malachi 2:16). Marriage mirrors His love for His people, as “your Maker is your husband” (Isaiah 54:5), and He expects it to be honored, warning, “Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers” (Hebrews 13:4).</p>
                        <p>The family unit is Jehovah’s design for stability and spiritual growth, a structure He protects with clear laws, as when He commanded Israel, “You must not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14), a rule that preserved their nation’s purity. In contrast, the Canaanites’ immorality—incest, bestiality—led to their destruction, for “the land became unclean, and I held it accountable for its error” (Leviticus 18:25). Today, true worshipers uphold marriage amidst a world that mocks it, reflecting Jehovah’s will that “love and faithfulness meet together” (Psalm 85:10). Parents teach children to “fear Jehovah all your days” (1 Samuel 12:24), as Timothy learned from his mother and grandmother, “from infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15). Jehovah blesses such families, promising, “I will pour out my spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants” (Isaiah 44:3), ensuring their role in His purpose endures.</p>
                        <h2>Roles</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah assigns distinct roles within the family, instructing husbands to “love your wives, just as Christ loved the congregation and gave himself up for it” (Ephesians 5:25), a sacrificial leadership as “head of the wife as Christ is head of the congregation” (Ephesians 5:23). Wives are to “be in subjection to your husbands” (1 Peter 3:1), a willing support that mirrors the congregation’s obedience to Christ, as Sarah honored Abraham, “calling him lord” (1 Peter 3:6). Children must “honor your father and your mother” (Ephesians 6:1-2), a command that brings “long life on the earth” (Ephesians 6:3), as when Joseph obeyed Jacob, prospering despite trials (Genesis 45:9-11). When Eli failed to discipline his sons around 1100 BCE, “Jehovah said, ‘I will do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone hearing it tingle’” (1 Samuel 3:11), and his house fell, showing that neglecting these roles angers Jehovah. True families reflect His order, for “he who loves his wife loves himself” (Ephesians 5:28), creating harmony that glorifies Him.</p>
                        <h2>Morality</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah sets the standard for morality, commanding His people, “You must be holy, because I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), a call rooted in His nature as “a God of faithfulness, without injustice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). Sins like fornication, homosexuality, and theft defile this holiness, as Paul warned, “Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body” (1 Corinthians 6:18). Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah around 1918 BCE for such acts, “making it rain sulfur and fire from Jehovah out of the heavens” (Genesis 19:24), because “their sin has become very grave” (Genesis 18:20), a judgment that stands as “an example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction” (2 Peter 2:6). His law to Israel, “You must not lie down with a male in the same way that you lie down with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22), and “You must not steal” (Exodus 20:15), reflects His unchanging moral code, for “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6). True worshipers uphold this, knowing “the wages sin pays is death” (Romans 6:23), while “those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom” (Galatians 5:19-21).</p>
                        <p>Love underpins Jehovah’s morality, as Jesus taught, “You must love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39), a principle that guides actions beyond mere rules, for “love does not work evil to one’s neighbor” (Romans 13:10). Yet, love does not excuse sin; when Achan stole devoted items around 1473 BCE, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel” (Joshua 7:1), and he was stoned, showing that disobedience brings consequences, as “Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3). Today’s world mirrors Noah’s day, “filled with violence” and “every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time” (Genesis 6:5, 11), yet Jehovah offers mercy, “return to me with all your heart” (Joel 2:12), promising “life to those who find them” (Proverbs 4:22). True morality reflects His character, as “the one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Conscience</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah gifted humans with a conscience, an inner guide reflecting His law, as “their conscience is bearing witness with them, and their thoughts between themselves are accusing or even excusing them” (Romans 2:15), a moral compass even pagans possess, as “the nations who do not have law do by nature the things of the law” (Romans 2:14). Training it is vital, for “the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience” (1 Timothy 1:5), ensuring “a good conscience before God” (1 Peter 3:21). When Israel ignored theirs, worshiping Molech, “I will set my face against that man” (Leviticus 20:5), and they fell. Today, a seared conscience—approving “men who love men” (1 Timothy 1:10)—leads to ruin, but Jehovah restores it through truth, as “we trust we have a good conscience” (Hebrews 13:18), aligning with “whatever things are true” (Philippians 4:8).</p>

            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Paradise</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s promise of a paradise earth is the ultimate hope for humanity, a restoration of Eden’s perfection, where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29), a destiny lost when Adam sinned around 4026 BCE, prompting the curse, “Cursed is the ground because of you” (Genesis 3:17). Jesus’ ransom reverses this, as “you were bought with a price” (1 Peter 1:18-19), paving the way for a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), and “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). This was Jehovah’s intent from creation, when He “planted a garden in Eden” (Genesis 2:8) and tasked man to “cultivate it and take care of it” (Genesis 2:15), a purpose reaffirmed by David, who longed, “I will dwell in the house of Jehovah forever” (Psalm 23:6). Lazarus’ raising, when “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), previews this, showing Jehovah’s power to restore life on earth, not in heaven.</p>
                        <p>The earth’s design confirms it as humanity’s eternal home, with its oxygen-rich air, fertile soil, and water cycle tailored for life, as “he did not create it simply for nothing, but he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). False religion claims heaven for all, but Jehovah says, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), a promise echoed when “the wolf will reside with the lamb” (Isaiah 11:6). After Armageddon, “they will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards” (Isaiah 65:21), a tangible future Jehovah secures, for “my word that goes out of my mouth will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11). True worshipers await this, rejecting Satan’s lies, as “the earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).</p>
                        <h2>Salvation</h2>
                        <p>Salvation is not automatic but a reward for faith and obedience, as Paul urged, “Keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), a process requiring “faith without works is dead” (James 2:26). Jehovah offers it through Jesus, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), but demands effort, for “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). False religion preaches instant salvation or damnation, but Jehovah ties it to deeds, as “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6). The earth, not heaven, is the prize, for “hope that is seen is not hope” (Romans 8:24), and Jehovah’s justice ensures “the righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4).</p>
                        <h2>Judgment</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah is the ultimate Judge, declaring, “Vengeance is mine, and retribution” (Deuteronomy 32:35), a role He exercises with perfect justice, as “Jehovah is a God of justice; happy are all those waiting for him” (Isaiah 30:18). History reveals His judgments: the Flood around 2370 BCE destroyed a wicked world, “every living thing that was on the surface of the ground died” (Genesis 7:22), because “the badness of man was abundant” (Genesis 6:5); Sodom’s fire around 1918 BCE, “he overthrew those cities” (Genesis 19:25), punished sexual perversion; and Jerusalem’s fall in 70 CE fulfilled Jesus’ words, “not a stone will be left here upon a stone” (Matthew 24:2), for rejecting Him. Armageddon looms, “the great day of Jehovah is near, and it is approaching very quickly” (Zephaniah 1:14), a “day of fury” (Zephaniah 1:15) that will end evil, as “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10). Yet, He offers escape, “seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be that you will be concealed on the day of Jehovah’s anger” (Zephaniah 2:3).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s judgments are not impulsive but deliberate, as “he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9), seen when He spared Nineveh after they repented, “God saw their works... and he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10). Yet, defiance brings swift action, as when He struck Uzziah with leprosy for usurping priestly duties, “the leprosy broke out on his forehead” (2 Chronicles 26:19). Today, “the Son of man will judge the nations” (Matthew 25:32), executing Jehovah’s will at Armageddon, “he treads the winepress of the wrath” (Revelation 19:15), but “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). His past acts—drowning Pharaoh’s army (Exodus 14:28)—assure this future, for “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9).</p>
                        <h2>Resurrection Judgment</h2>
                        <p>The resurrection judgment is Jehovah’s promise to raise the dead, both “the righteous and the unrighteous” (Acts 24:15), a hope rooted in His power, as “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28-29). The righteous, like Abraham, who “received the promise” (Hebrews 11:17-19), rise to life, while the unrighteous, like those in Sodom, face judgment “according to their deeds” (Revelation 20:12-13). This occurs after Armageddon, in “the new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “the sea gave up the dead” (Revelation 20:13), proving no one escapes Jehovah’s reach, for “I will bring back your captives” (Zephaniah 3:20). Lazarus’ raising, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), foreshadows this, as does Daniel’s prophecy, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). Jehovah’s justice ensures fairness, “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6), and this judgment offers a second chance for many, as “death and Hades gave up those dead in them” (Revelation 20:13), aligning with His mercy, for “he does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9).</p>
                        <p>Unlike false religion’s hellfire or reincarnation, Jehovah’s resurrection is a single, earthly restoration, as “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), not a spirit realm. He demonstrated this power when Elijah raised the widow’s son, “Jehovah listened to Elijah’s voice, and the child’s life came back into him” (1 Kings 17:22), and when Jesus called forth Lazarus, showing “I am the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25). This judgment separates the faithful, who “enter into life” (Matthew 25:46), from the wicked, who face “everlasting cutting-off” (Daniel 12:2), a final verdict that fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “the upright are the ones that will reside in the earth” (Proverbs 2:21). True worshipers trust this hope, for “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial” (2 Peter 2:9).</p>
                        <h2>Death</h2>
                        <p>Death is not a gateway to an afterlife but a state of unconsciousness, as Jehovah declared to Adam, “Dust you are and to dust you will return” (Genesis 3:19), and Solomon confirmed, “The dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). This truth counters Satan’s lie in Eden, “You positively will not die” (Genesis 3:4), which birthed myths of immortal souls, a concept absent from Scripture but rampant in Egyptian beliefs around 3000 BCE and Greek philosophy by 500 BCE. Jehovah’s Word states, “The soul that sins—it itself will die” (Ezekiel 18:20), equating the soul with the living being, not a separate entity, as “the breath of life” animates man (Genesis 2:7). Science aligns with this—brain death ends awareness, with no evidence of a spirit surviving, as “his spirit goes out, he returns to the ground” (Psalm 146:4). Jehovah alone reverses death, promising, “I will cause a ransom for them from the power of the Grave” (Hosea 13:14), a hope tied to resurrection, not an instant heaven.</p>
                        <p>Jehovah views death as an enemy, “the last enemy to be brought to nothing is death” (1 Corinthians 15:26), introduced by sin but conquered by Christ’s ransom, for “through one man death spread to all men” (Romans 5:12), yet “through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is their being declared righteous for life” (Romans 5:18). When He struck 185,000 Assyrians in one night, “they were all dead bodies” (2 Kings 19:35), it showed His power over life, but His purpose is restoration, as “he will swallow up death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). False religion’s tales of torment or glory at death collapse under Jehovah’s truth—sleep awaits until “the day of Jehovah comes” (1 Thessalonians 5:2), when “those who belong to the Christ will rise first” (1 Thessalonians 4:16).</p>
                        <h2>Hell</h2>
                        <p>The doctrine of hell as eternal torment is a satanic lie, not Jehovah’s truth, for “God is love” (1 John 4:8), and “love does not work evil to one’s neighbor” (Romans 13:10)—endless suffering contradicts His nature. Scripture uses “hell” (Hebrew: Sheol; Greek: Hades) as the common grave, not a fiery prison, as “Sheol and Abaddon lie open before Jehovah” (Proverbs 15:11), a place of silence, not screams, for “there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave” (Ecclesiastes 9:10). When Jonah cried “out of the belly of Sheol” (Jonah 2:2), he meant near death in the fish, not a torture chamber, and Jehovah delivered him, “you brought my life up from the pit” (Jonah 2:6). The “lake of fire” in Revelation 20:14 is symbolic—“death and Hades were hurled into it”—meaning destruction, not torment, as “this means the second death” (Revelation 20:14), annihilation for the wicked, echoing Sodom’s fate, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), leaving “smoke ascending forever” (Revelation 14:11), a permanent end, not ongoing pain.</p>
                        <p>Pagan myths, like Egypt’s underworld Duat from 3000 BCE or Greece’s Hades by 1200 BCE, birthed this falsehood, adopted by Christendom in the third century CE to control the masses, but Jehovah’s justice is clear: “The soul that sins—it itself will die” (Ezekiel 18:20), not burn eternally. He destroyed the wicked at the Flood, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), and promises the same at Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), not tortured. Jesus’ parable of Lazarus and the rich man (Luke 16:19-31) is symbolic, not literal—Abraham’s bosom signifies favor, not location—yet false religion twists it. Jehovah’s mercy shines, “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4), proving hell is a lie Satan uses to “blind the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4).</p>
                        <h2>Afterlife</h2>
                        <p>No afterlife exists in Jehovah’s purpose—death is a sleep until resurrection, as “the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), and Jesus said of Lazarus, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep” (John 11:11), before raising him. Satan’s Edenic lie, “You will not die” (Genesis 3:4), fuels myths of spirits or heavens, but Jehovah’s Word refutes this: “The dust returns to the earth, just as it was” (Ecclesiastes 12:7), and “man’s spirit” is his life force, not a soul, as “all the while my breath is in me” (Job 27:3). Science finds no consciousness beyond death—EEG scans flatline at brain death—aligning with “he returns to his earth; on that very day his thoughts perish” (Psalm 146:4). Jehovah’s plan is earthly, “the earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4), not a ghostly realm, as “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s past acts reinforce this: Enoch and Elijah didn’t ascend alive—“no man has ascended into heaven” (John 3:13)—but were transferred, as “Enoch was transferred so as not to see death” (Hebrews 11:5), likely dying later, and Elijah went up “in a whirlwind” (2 Kings 2:11), yet wrote afterward (2 Chronicles 21:12). False religion’s heaven-or-hell tales, rooted in Babylon’s spirit worship around 2000 BCE, collapse before Jehovah’s truth, “I will open your graves and bring you up” (Ezekiel 37:12), a resurrection to earth, not an instant afterlife. His promise is solid, “you will call, and I will answer you; you will long for the work of your hands” (Job 14:15), a future paradise where “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” —Psalm 37:29</p>
