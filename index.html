                    <summary class="item-button">Nature’s Design Reveals Truth</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Cosmos and Earth Testify to Jehovah’s Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>The universe’s majestic order, from galaxies to oceans, proclaims Jehovah’s purposeful design, as “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and the expanse is proclaiming the work of his hands.” Creation’s harmony and complexity demand a divine architect, evident in every star and wave. — Psalm 19:1</p>

                        <h3>Galaxies: Cosmic Masterpieces</h3>
                        <p>Over 2 trillion galaxies, each with 100 billion stars, orbit with precision, as “He is counting the number of the stars; all of them he calls by their names.” The Milky Way spans 100,000 light-years, its 200 billion stars in perfect balance. David was awed, saying, “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?” The Hubble telescope reveals galaxies 13.8 billion light-years away, as “Jehovah’s works are great.” Their 10^24 stars, orbiting at 1.3 million mph, defy chance, proving “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” — Psalm 147:4, Psalm 8:3-4, Psalm 111:2, Psalm 104:24</p>

                        <h3>Ecosystems: Interwoven Harmony</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s ecosystems, like coral reefs with 1 million species, thrive in balance, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” Rainforests, 6% of land, produce 20% oxygen for 7.8 billion people. Isaiah declared, “It is he who stretched out the heavens like a fine gauze.” One forest acre hosts 70,000 insects, 1,500 plants, 200 mammals, as “All things came into existence through him.” This interdependence, recycling 10 billion tons of carbon yearly, demands design. — Psalm 104:24, Isaiah 40:22, John 1:3</p>

                        <h3>Weather Systems: Cycles of Renewal</h3>
                        <p>Weather cycles 37.5 trillion tons of water across 510 million square kilometers, as “All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the streams flow, there they return to flow again.” Elijah saw Jehovah’s rain, praying, “There will be showers of blessing.” Hurricanes release 600 trillion watts, nurturing ecosystems. Winds obey, as “He makes his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire.” This precision, as “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” proves divine order. — Ecclesiastes 1:7, Ezekiel 34:26, Psalm 104:4, Ecclesiastes 3:11</p>

                        <h3>Geologic Formations: Enduring Testimony</h3>
                        <p>Mountains like Everest (29,032 feet) and canyons like the Grand Canyon (277 miles) showcase power, as “He has established the mountains by his strength.” Moses saw Sinai quake, saying, “The mountains melted like wax before Jehovah.” Plate tectonics recycle 43,000 square miles of crust, stabilizing earth. These, as “The earth is Jehovah’s and all that fills it,” endure as proof. — Psalm 65:6, Psalm 97:5, 1 Corinthians 10:26</p>

                        <h3>Oceans: Vast Reservoirs of Life</h3>
                        <p>Oceans, covering 71% of earth, hold 1.332 billion km³ of water, as “He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; he puts the deep waters in storehouses.” Jonah survived in the deep, trusting, “Salvation is from Jehovah.” Currents like the Gulf Stream move 100 million cubic meters/second, regulating climate. Hosting 230,000 species, oceans produce 50% of oxygen, as “There is no searching out of his understanding.” This vastness proves design. — Psalm 33:7, Jonah 2:9, Isaiah 40:28</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Stargaze for galaxies, hike forests for ecosystems, track storms, visit canyons, or dive oceans. Journal observations, meditate on Jehovah’s wisdom, and share insights, as “Sing to Jehovah a new song, for he has done wonderful things!” — Psalm 98:1</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and the expanse is proclaiming the work of his hands. — Psalm 19:1</p>

            <!-- Item 2: Human Conscience Points to Truth -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Human Conscience Points to Truth</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Innate Morality Reflects Divine Standards</h2>
                        <p>The human conscience, guiding right from wrong, reveals Jehovah’s truth, as “Their conscience is bearing witness, and their thoughts between themselves are accusing or even excusing them.” Universal across cultures, it sets humans apart, pointing to a divine moral code. — Romans 2:15</p>

                        <h3>Innate Morality in Infants</h3>
                        <p>Babies at 6 months prefer kindness, showing innate morality, as “For your own purpose you have made everything, even the wicked for the day of disaster.” Joseph resisted sin, saying, “How could I commit this great evil and actually sin against God?” Studies show 80% of toddlers share, echoing “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” This instinct, as “They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts,” proves a divine imprint. — Proverbs 16:4, Genesis 39:9, Leviticus 19:18, Romans 2:15</p>

                        <h3>Universal Ethical Codes</h3>
                        <p>Cultures uphold justice and compassion, as “He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk in modesty with your God!” Paul urged, “Always maintain a good conscience.” 99% of societies condemn murder, aligning with “You must not murder.” This unity, as “Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,” demands purpose. — Micah 6:8, Acts 24:16, Exodus 20:13, Psalm 119:142</p>

                        <h3>Conscience and Repentance</h3>
                        <p>Conscience prompts repentance, as David prayed, “My errors have overwhelmed me, but I will confess my transgression to Jehovah, and you forgave the error of my sins.” Peter wept, convicted, as “Before a rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.” 70% of people correct wrongs due to guilt, as “Return to Jehovah, and he will have mercy on you.” This mechanism, as “You know the hearts of all,” reveals design. — Psalm 32:5, Mark 14:30, Isaiah 55:7, 1 Chronicles 28:9</p>

                        <h3>Conscience in Decision-Making</h3>
                        <p>Conscience guides choices, as Daniel resolved, “He would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies or with the wine he drank.” Jesus upheld truth, saying, “For this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.” The prefrontal cortex processes 100,000 decisions daily, as “I have chosen the way of faithfulness.” This capacity, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot,” proves Jehovah’s truth. — Daniel 1:8, John 18:37, Psalm 119:30, Psalm 119:105</p>

                        <h3>Conscience and Empathy</h3>
                        <p>Empathy drives moral acts, as the Samaritan helped, showing “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” Job cared for the needy, saying, “I was a father to the poor.” Mirror neurons fire when seeing pain, prompting 85% to aid strangers. This trait, as “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person,” reflects divine intent. — Luke 10:33-34, Job 29:16, 1 Corinthians 10:24</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Reflect on conscience-driven choices, study scriptures to refine it, and act with empathy. Teach children moral values, as “Train a boy in the way he should go.” — Proverbs 22:6</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Their conscience is bearing witness, and their thoughts between themselves are accusing or even excusing them. — Romans 2:15</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Creation’s Cycles Teach Trust</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Rhythms of Nature Show Reliability</h2>
                        <p>Nature’s cycles—seasons, tides, migrations, orbits, and rotations—demonstrate Jehovah’s dependable truth, as “As long as the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.” Their precision fosters trust in His eternal order. — Genesis 8:22</p>

                        <h3>Seasonal Balance</h3>
                        <p>Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt drives seasons, yielding 4.5 billion tons of crops, as “You have made the sun and the moon.” Noah trusted renewal, as “I will never again curse the ground because of man.” Seasons regulate 70% of ecosystems, producing 150 billion tons of biomass. This rhythm, as “Jehovah’s loyal love endures forever,” proves design. — Psalm 74:16, Genesis 8:22, Psalm 100:5</p>

                        <h3>Tidal Harmony</h3>
                        <p>The moon’s gravity cycles tides every 12.4 hours, moving 1.4 trillion tons of water, as “You made the moon to mark the appointed times.” Jesus noted reliability, saying, “He makes his sun rise on both the evil and the good and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.” Tides sustain 50% of marine life, cleaning 71% of earth.

This eternity, as “The heavens declare his righteousness,” inspires hope. — Psalm 147:4, Genesis 22:17, Psalm 97:6</p>

                        <h3>Clouds: Emblems of Guidance</h3>
                        <p>Clouds, holding 10^15 gallons of water, guide climates, as “He covers the heavens with clouds; he prepares rain for the earth.” Israelites followed a cloud, as “Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud.” Moving 100 mph, they shade 60% of earth. This guidance, as “There is no searching out his understanding,” teaches trust. — Psalm 147:8, Exodus 13:21, Isaiah 40:28</p>

                        <h3>Practical Steps</h3>
                        <p>Study trees for endurance, rivers for persistence, stars for hope, and clouds for guidance. Reflect on lessons, journal insights, and grow in faith, as “I will meditate on all your activity.” — Psalm 77:12</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Consider the lilies, how they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. — Luke 12:27</p>
